      "description": "“Nesbø’s storytelling abilities are incomparable. Nemesis is crime novel as art form and great entertainment.” —USA Today The #1 international bestseller from one of the most celebrated crime writers in Europe—the New York Times bestselling author of The Snowman—Jo Nesbø’s extraordinary thriller Nemesis features Norwegian homicide detective Harry Hole, “the next in the long line of great noir crime detectives,” (San Diego Union-Tribune) in a case as dark and chilling as an Oslo winter’s night. The second Harry Hole novel to be released in America—following the critically acclaimed publication of The Redbird—Nemesis is a superb and surprising nail-biter that places Jo Nesbø in the company of Lawrence Block, Ian Rankin, Michael Connelly, and other top masters of crime fiction. Nesbø has already received the Glass Key Award and the Booksellers’ Prize, Norway’s most prestigious literary awards. Nemesis is proof that there are certainly more honors in this extraordinary writer's future. *Edgar Nominee for Best Novel of the Year",

The twenty-eight-year-old writer is the new darling of American letters, whose debut novel has sold two million copies. But when it comes time to produce a new book, he is sidelined by a crippling case of writer’s block. He travels to Somerset, New Hamprshire, to see his mentor, Harry Quebert, one of the country’s most respected writers, hoping to jar his creative juices as his publisher’s deadline looms. But Marcus’s plans are upended when Harry is sensationally implicated in a cold-case murder: Fifteen-year-old Nola Kellergan went missing in 1975, and Harry admits to having had an affair with her. Following a trail of clues through the backwoods and isolated beaches of New Hampshire, Marcus must answer two questions, which are mysteriously connected: Who killed Nola Kellergan? And how do you write a book to save someone’s life?

      "description": "In this volume, the author reviews the results of research on language performance and proposes a model of production and comprehension. Although recent developments in linguistics are taken into account, consideration of other requirements of a performance model leads to the conclusion that the grammar the speaker has in mind differs from the grammar as currently conceived of by most linguists. The author is also critical of recent computer simulations of language performance on the basis that they fall short of describing what goes on in human production and comprehension. The author therefore proposes that the basic issues must be rethought and new theoretical foundations reformulated, in order to arrive at a viable theory of language functioning. In developing the framework of the model presented in this book, requirements of flexibility in the performance mechanisms, the probabilistic nature of comprehension processes, and the interleaving of linguistic rules with context and knowledge of the world are emphasized.",

      "description": "Originally designed as a cargo and paratroop transport during World War II, the Fairchild C-82 Packet is today mainly remembered for its starring role in the Hollywood film The Flight of the Phoenix (1965). Its ungainly appearance earned it the nickname \"the flying boxcar\" but the aircraft was the first to achieve practical end-loading and aerial delivery of cargoes. Its outsized capacity served the U.S. military's needs for more than ten years--civilian operators flew it in remote locations like Alaska and South America for a further three decades. This book provides a comprehensive history of the C-82, detailing each of the 224 aircraft built, with technical diagrams, multiple appendices and more than 200 photos.",

      "description": "This book focuses on the fundamentals and recent advances in RGB-D imaging as well as covering a range of RGB-D applications. The topics covered include: data acquisition, data quality assessment, filling holes, 3D reconstruction, SLAM, multiple depth camera systems, segmentation, object detection, salience detection, pose estimation, geometric modelling, fall detection, autonomous driving, motor rehabilitation therapy, people counting and cognitive service robots. The availability of cheap RGB-D sensors has led to an explosion over the last five years in the capture and application of colour plus depth data. The addition of depth data to regular RGB images vastly increases the range of applications, and has resulted in a demand for robust and real-time processing of RGB-D data. There remain many technical challenges, and RGB-D image processing is an ongoing research area. This book covers the full state of the art, and consists of a series of chapters by internationally renowned experts in the field. Each chapter is written so as to provide a detailed overview of that topic. RGB-D Image Analysis and Processing will enable both students and professional developers alike to quickly get up to speed with contemporary techniques, and apply RGB-D imaging in their own projects.",

      "description": "The contribution of landing craft and their crews to the 1944 Normandy campaign was enormous, and often overlooked. Most of the more than 132,000 Allied troops who landed on the beaches on D-Day came ashore from landing craft. The book examines why so many different types of landing craft were used in the operation; how they were built in both the UK and North America, over several years and with many competing war production requirements and operational needs. In the lead up to D-Day the Allies never seemed to have enough landing craft, their availability and production regularly discussed by top Allied leaders. This account is essential to anyone who wants to fully understand the course of D-Day, and the nature of Allied preparations for the campaign.",

This book, based on action research, provides a simple answer to this fundamental question by exploring a key technique that enables teachers and learners to use available technologies happily and successfully. So, what are e-tivities? They are motivating, engaging, purposeful activities developed and led by an e-moderator. They are frameworks for active and interactive online learning. E-tivities are in the hands of the teachers themselves and promote active e-learning. This is not a book about the technology of online learning. Practical, accessible and direct, it looks at personalizing and customizing teaching and learning. Written for use in any topic, subject or course, E-tivities explores: the importance of activities in online learning; designing and running e-tivities; the five-stage model of teaching and learning online. Backed up extensive illustrations and case studies, and including a unique collection of 35 Resources for Practitioners, this is a book for all professionals involved in online learning.",

Il volume, pur conservando l’originaria agilità di consultazione, fornisce una trattazione completa ed esaustiva del quadro di riferimento per la qualificazione e quantificazione dei redditi di lavoro dipendente ed assimilati, ne analizza le varie fattispecie che si possono incontrare nella pratica professionale, con particolare attenzione alla disciplina delle trasferte, e le relative modalità di rimborso degli oneri sostenuti dai dipendenti, e a quella dei fringe benefits. L’ultimo capitolo è stato riservato all’esame della disciplina della deducibilità, sia ai fini delle imposte dirette (Irpef/Ires) sia ai fini IRAP, degli oneri connessi ai dipendenti e collaboratori, per aiutare nella determinazione degli importi deducibili specie quelli la cui deduzione è soggetta a limitazioni. Utile per chi deve affrontare la compilazione della dichiarazione dei redditi.",

      "description": "More than two million medical students, doctors and other health professionals from around the globe have owned a copy of Davidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine since it was first published. Today’s readers rely on this beautifully illustrated text to provide up-to-date detail of contemporary medical practice, presented in a style that is concise and yet easy to read. Davidson’s provides the factual knowledge required to practise medicine, explaining it in the context of underlying principles, basic science and research evidence, and shows how to apply this knowledge to the management of patients who present with problems rather than specific diseases. The book has won numerous prizes including being highly commended in the British Medical Association book awards. Davidson’s global perspective is enhanced by the input of an international team of authors and a distinguished International Advisory Board from 17 countries. Building on the foundations laid down by its original editor, Davidson’s remains one of the world’s leading and most respected textbooks of medicine. The underlying principles of medicine are described concisely in the first part of the book, and the detailed practice of medicine within each sub-specialty is described in later system-based chapters. Most chapters begin with a two-page overview of the important elements of the clinical examination, including a manikin to illustrate the key steps in the examination of the relevant system. A practical, problem-based clinical approach is described in the ‘Presenting Problems’ sections, to complement the detailed descriptions of each disease. The text is extensively illustrated, with over 1000 diagrams, clinical photographs, and radiology and pathology images. 1350 text boxes present information in a way suitable for revision, including 150 clinical evidence boxes summarising the results of systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials and 65 ’In Old Age’ boxes highlighting important aspects of medical practice in the older population. A combined index and glossary of medical acronyms contains over 10 000 subject entries. The contents can also be searched comprehensively as part of the online access to the whole book on the StudentConsult platform. Access over 500 self-testing questions with answers linked to the book’s content for further reading. The text uses both SI and non-SI units to make it suitable for readers throughout the globe. A new chapter specifically on Stroke Disease recognises the emergence of Stroke Medicine as a distinct clinical and academic discipline. A rationalisation of the 1350 boxes used throughout the book gives a simpler and clearer presentation of the various categories. New ‘In Adolescence’ boxes recognise the fact that many chronic disorders begin in childhood and become the responsibility of physicians practising adult medicine. These boxes acknowledge the overlap ‘transitional’ phase and highlight the key points of importance when looking after young people. The regular introduction of new authors and editors maintains the freshness of each new edition. On this occasion Dr Ian Penman has joined the editorial team and 18 new authors bring new experience and ideas to the content and presentation of the textbook. An expanded International Advisory Board of 38 members includes new members from several different countries.",

A hoax call immediately followed Billy's cry for help, and believing that the two were connected, the U.S. Coast Guard did not launch rescue units for several days. The Hokansons' deaths prompted a new anti-hoax law and changed United States Coast Guard search and rescue procedures. Historian Captain W. Russ Webster, U.S. Coast Guard (Ret.), and journalist Elizabeth B. Webster chronicle the fascinating story of the \"Sol e Mar\" and its crew and explain the psychology of hoax callers and Coast Guard technological advancements since the tragedy.",

      "description": "World War II saw the development of the heavy bomber as a decisive weapon which, in sufficient numbers, could overcome defensive fighters and guns and lay waste to strategic targets. The addition of nuclear weapons to the bomber's armament made it even more formidable, and by the late 1940s, US planners saw the growth of a Soviet nuclear-armed bomber fleet as a terrifying threat to North American security. Conventional subsonic fighters with guns and free-flight air-to-air rockets would be incapable of reaching these incoming bombers in time to prevent even one from delivering a devastating nuclear attack. As a result, supersonic speed, long-range guided missiles and precise radar-based control of an interception became prerequisites for a new breed of fighters, beginning with the F-102. A massive research and development effort produced the F-102A '1954 Fighter', the J57 afterburning turbojet, its Hughes MX-1554 fire control system and, in due course, the Semi-Active Ground Environment (SAGE) radar and communications network that covered North America to guide its airborne defences. In service, F-102As also provided air defence in Europe with USAFE, in the Far East and in Southeast Asia, where they protected US airbases in South Vietnam and Thailand from air attack by North Vietnamese fighters and bombers and escorted B-52s and fighter-bombers on their attack sorties. This illustrated study from leading expert Peter E. Davis details the design, development, and deployment of the futuristic F-102, including its complex research program and role in Vietnam.",

      "description": "This book provides an important study of the theology of Thomas F. Torrance, who is generally considered to have been one of the most significant theologians writing in English during the twentieth century, with a view toward showing how his theological method and all his major doctrinal views were shaped by his understanding of the doctrine of the Trinity. Torrance pursued a theology that was realist because he attempted to think in accordance with the unique nature of the object that is known. In holding to such a methodology, he drew an analogy between theology and natural science. This book demonstrates how, for Torrance, God relates with humanity within time and space so that creation finds its meaning in relation to God and not in itself; this enabled him to avoid many theological pitfalls such as agnosticism, subjectivism and dualism while explaining the positive implications of various Christian doctrines in a penetrating and compelling manner. This book offers an important resource for students of theology and for scholars who are interested in seeing how serious dogmatic theology shapes and should shape our understanding of the Christian life.",

The approach is also helpful for other personality disorders and conditions that are difficult to treat, e.g. addiction and eating disorders. MBT consists of a psychoeducational, an individual, and a group therapy component. This is the first comprehensive manual for mentalization-based group therapy. The author has developed the manual in close cooperation with Anthony Bateman and a team of group analysts. It covers all the aspects of MBT which are necessary to produce an informed and qualified group therapist. The book covers the theory behind mentalization and borderline personality disorder (especially its evolutionary roots), the structure of MBT and a discussion of previous experiences with group psychotherapy for borderline patients. The core of the book explains the main principles of MBT-G and provides a powerful means for ensuring that therapists adhere to these principles in a qualified way. The last part contains a full transcript from a real MBT group composed of borderline patients. As the first book dedicated to Group MBT, this book is a valuable and unique addition to the Mentalization literature.",

      "description": "The medieval poem Cursor Mundi is a biblical verse account of the history of the world, offering a chronological overview of salvation history from Creation to Doomsday. Originating in northern England around the year 1300, the poem was frequently copied in the north before appearing in a southern version in substantially altered form. Although it is a storehouse of popular medieval biblical lore and a fascinating study in the eclectic use of more than a dozen sources, the poem has until now attracted little scholarly attention. This five-part collaborative edition presents the Arundel version of the poem with variants from three others. In addition, it provides a discussion of sources and analogues, detailed explanatory notes, and a bibliography. Published in English.",

A subject so important must be treated with care and attention and this book aims to provide the reader with a comprehensive, detailed, and accessible guide to this important topic. In this ground-breaking book, all elements of Salāh are expounded chapter by chapter, with useful translations and transliterations of original Arabic terms and phrases. Beginning with the history of the prayer, we progress through an analysis of the types of Salāh, its spiritual and physical benefits, and a unique step-by-step guide on learning to pray for those new to the practice. With this book, there should no longer be any confusion or lack of knowledge regarding Salāh. It is hoped that this book, written with the intention of easing the performance of the five daily prayers, will help readers understand the beauty of this ritual and turn it into an enjoyable daily experience, such that it is spiritually enriching and accepted in the eyes of Almighty God.",

Unflinching in his honesty, Powell deals frankly with the aftermath of the accident that took the life of his girlfriend and left him with injuries that affect him to this day. Leaders of the glam rock movement, Slade were the UK s biggest singles band in the years 1971-74. Their many hits have become rock n roll standards, not least Merry Christmas Everybody , arguably Britain s all-time favourite Christmas song. For Don Powell, though, success came at a price. Lucky to survive, the aftermath of his accident included alcoholism, financial woes and a life of reckless promiscuity. Now sober and settled in Denmark with an adopted family of his own, Don Powell s story as told to Lise Lyng Falkenberg is a no-nonsense journey to the heights and depths of the rock world.",

      "description": "This memoir of “a happy childhood in rural Missouri just before the digital revolution [is] a sweet record of a time and a place that was not Always On.” —St. Louis Post-Dispatch Spanning one year of the author’s life—1984—I Will Not Leave You Comfortless is the intimate memoir of a young boy coming to consciousness in small-town Missouri. The year will bring ten-year-old Jeremy first loves, first losses, and a break from the innocence of boyhood that will never be fully repaired. For Jeremy, the seeming security of his life on the family farm is forever shaken by the life-altering events of that pivotal year. Throughout, he recalls the deeply sensual wonders of his rural Midwestern childhood—bicycle rides in September sunlight; the horizon vanishing behind tall grasses—while stories both heart-wrenching and humorous, tragic and triumphant, Jackson weaves past, present, and future into the rich Missouri landscape. “I could smell the mulberries crushed underfoot and the sweet steam of the cinnamon roll Grandma heated in the toaster oven just for Jeremy, hear the ever-increasing volume of an approaching late-spring storm . . . The year of Jeremy Jackson’s life on which he meditates in I Will Not Leave You Comfortless marked his transition from the perfect happiness of childhood to the much more complex reality of adulthood. It records, as well, the abiding comfort that remains—family, home and love.” —Wichita Eagle “Jackson writes about Missouri as the young Hemingway wrote about Michigan: with a clear eye; with hard-edged nostalgia; and (here’s the thing) with brilliance.” —Darin Strauss, author of Half a Life",

(He was one of the best students that year, by the way. ) Because of his background, Fred has taken, in the Guide, the point of view of an experienced student tutor helping you to learn calculus. \\~ile we do not always think Fred's jokes are as funny as he does, we appreciate his enthusiasm and his desire to enter into communication with his readers; since we nearly always agree with the mathe matical judgements he has made in explaining the material, we believe that this Guide can serve you as a valuable supplement to our text. To get maximum benefit from this Guide, you should begin by spending a few moments to acquaint yourself with its structure. Once you get started in the course, take advantage of the many opportunities which the text and Student Guide together provide for learning calculus in the only way that any mathe matical subject can truly be mastered - through attempting to solve problems on your own. As you read the text, try doing each example and exercise your self before reading the solution; do the same with the quiz problems provided by Fred.",

      "description": "Among the most famous visionaries of our times, J. Krishnamurti (1895–1986) continues to transform thought, lifestyles, and education across continents more than three decades after his death. In this new biography, tracing the nine long decades of his life, from his growing-up years, his relationships to his writings and talks, Roshen Dalal provides a much-needed corrective – an objective and balanced view of his legacy. Adopted by Theosophists at the age of fourteen, and proclaimed a world teacher and messiah, in 1929, Krishnamurti dissolved the Order of the Star created for him and went on to develop his own philosophy. What is it about his ideas that draws the following of generations of people? Delivered to a divided world then, what makes his message so relevant now? While his ideas on education are idealistic, why do they continue to be everlasting in their contribution and appeal? Krishnamurti’s vision is of a world without boundaries or wars, a world where compassion and goodness predominate, and his message is that such a world can be arrived at only through individual transformation.B24 There is no direct path to transformation, yet through intense perception and understanding, it is possible to achieve this goal. Carefully reconstructing the events and extracting the essence of his talks, Dalal dispels several myths, explains his teachings, and reveals the underlying theosophical and occult influence in Krishnamurti’s life. Here is the most complete biography yet, of one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century.",

From southeast Washington, DC, where the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers meet, Fort Lesley J. McNair still protects America's capital. In 1791, Pierre L'Enfant designated it as a military reservation. The post is the third oldest in continuous operation--as an arsenal, a penitentiary, a hospital, and now, a military education center. It was renamed in 1948 to honor Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, who was killed in World War II. Over the course of two centuries, the fort has borne witness to the British ransacking during the War of 1812; a Civil War explosion that killed female arsenal workers; and the incarceration, trial, and hanging of Lincoln assassination conspirators. Over time, it became the home of several artillery commands, the first federal penitentiary, the US Army Engineer School, the US Army Music School, the US Army War College and the US Army Band (Pershing's Own). Today, it has evolved into the National Defense University, Inter-American Defense College and the headquarters of the Military District of Washington.",

      "description": "J. Hillis Miller is undoubtedly one of the most important literary critics of the past century. For well over five decades his work has been at the forefront of theoretical and philosophical thinking and writing. From his earliest work with Georges Poulet and the so-called Geneva School, which introduced a generation of North American critics to the concept of a phenomenological literary hermeneutic, to a deconstructive rhetorical philology and an ethically motivated textual analysis, Miller's readings have not only reflected major movements in literary theory, they have also created them.Surprisingly, Eamonn Dunne's J. Hillis Miller and the Possibilities of Reading is the first book devoted exclusively to examining Miller's work. Dunne argues that an appreciation of Miller is crucial to an informed understanding about the radical changes occurring in critical thinking in the humanities in recent years. This book, the first of its kind, will be a vital and enabling avenue for further research into J. Hillis Miller's exemplary and prolific output.",

      "description": "These notes are based on the course of lectures I gave at Harvard in the fall of 1964. They constitute a self-contained account of vector bundles and K-theory assuming only the rudiments of point-set topology and linear algebra. One of the features of the treatment is that no use is made of ordinary homology or cohomology theory. In fact, rational cohomology is defined in terms of K-theory.The theory is taken as far as the solution of the Hopf invariant problem and a start is mode on the J-homomorphism. In addition to the lecture notes proper, two papers of mine published since 1964 have been reproduced at the end. The first, dealing with operations, is a natural supplement to the material in Chapter III. It provides an alternative approach to operations which is less slick but more fundamental than the Grothendieck method of Chapter III, and it relates operations and filtration. Actually, the lectures deal with compact spaces, not cell-complexes, and so the skeleton-filtration does not figure in the notes. The second paper provides a new approach to K-theory and so fills an obvious gap in the lecture notes.",

      "description": "In this book the author takes a pedagogic approach to Algebraic K-theory. He tried to find the shortest route possible, with complete details, to arrive at the homotopy approach of Quillen [Q] to Algebraic K-theory, with a simple goal to produce a self-contained and comprehensive pedagogic document in Algebraic K-theory, that is accessible to upper level graduate students. That is precisely what this book faithfully executes and achieves.The contents of this book can be divided into three parts — (1) The main body (Chapters 2-8), (2) Epilogue Chapters (Chapters 9, 10, 11) and (3) the Background and preliminaries (Chapters A, B, C, 1). The main body deals with Quillen's definition of K-theory and the K-theory of schemes. Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 provide expositions of the paper of Quillen [Q], and chapter 4 is on agreement of Classical K-theory and Quillen K-theory. Chapter 8 is an exposition of the work of Swan [Sw1] on K-theory of quadrics.The Epilogue chapters can be viewed as a natural progression of Quillen's work and methods. These represent significant benchmarks and include Waldhausen K-theory, Negative K-theory, Hermitian K-theory, 𝕂-theory spectra, Grothendieck-Witt theory spectra, Triangulated categories, Nori-Homotopy and its relationships with Chow-Witt obstructions for projective modules. In most cases, the proofs are improvisation of methods of Quillen [Q].The background, preliminaries and tools needed in chapters 2-11, are developed in chapters A on Category Theory and Exact Categories, B on Homotopy, C on CW Complexes, and 1 on Simplicial Sets.",

      "description": "Le boom des ressources naturelles en Afrique a tiré la croissance dans toute la région, sans contribuer de manière substantielle à améliorer le bien-être et les moyens de subsistance des citoyens. Les personnes vivant dans les pays africains richement dotés en ressources naturelles sont moins alphabétisées de 3 %, ont une espérance de vie plus faible de 4,5 ans et affichent des taux de malnutrition plus élevés chez les femmes et les enfants que dans les pays de la région n’ayant pas de ressources naturelles. Cette lenteur dans la réduction de la pauvreté est souvent attribuée à la croissance économique tirée par les ressources naturelles †“ la dénommée malédiction des ressources naturelles. Au-delà de l’impact global, les communautés vivant à proximité des centres miniers souffrent-elles également d’une malédiction des ressources naturelles ? L’exploitation minière en Afrique †“ Les communautés locales en tirent-elles parti ? examine comment l’exploitation aurifère à grande échelle dans trois pays †“ le Ghana, le Mali et la Tanzanie †“ affecte les moyens de subsistance et les communautés locales. L’analyse et les résultats des auteurs concluent qu’en moyenne, les communautés minières bénéficient d’avantages sociaux positifs bien que limités. L’étude définit trois grands canaux †“ marché, fiscal et environnemental †“ pouvant affecter les localités. Les auteurs appliquent ce cadre d’analyse à l’exploitation aurifère à grande échelle dans les trois pays de l’étude et ils utilisent des méthodes économétriques solides pour évaluer ces effets au niveau local. Si le défi de l’extraction des ressources naturelles est traité dans toutes ses dimensions, des pistes pour une prospérité partagée et une meilleure égalité peuvent être ouvertes, créant ainsi une vie meilleure pour les familles et améliorant les perspectives des pays dans lesquels elles vivent. Ce livre a pour objectif d’éclairer les politiques publiques et le comportement des entreprises concernant le bien-être des communautés situées à proximité des sites d’extraction et les opportunités que l’activité minière peut leur offrir.",

      "description": "Dans ce livre, compos de deux volets, mon intention est de confronter l'humanisme ancien l'humanisme moderne. En opposition avec les modernes, les Anciens s'efforcent d'couter la nature. Respecter l'harmonie naturelle devient la rgle d'or de l'homme ancien qui s'vertue l'appliquer dans toutes les manifestations de sa vie individuelle et sociale. L'humanisme ancien est fond sur l'altrit dissemblable. Pour cet humanisme, l'autre est celui qui ne possde pas la culture du juste (athmistos), le barbare, donc celui qui, au lieu de pratiquer la vertu, s'applique l'exercice de la violence. Cette culture, comprenant la fois une dimension thique et juridique, transforme une vie d'anarchie et de laideur, symptmes de l'injustice, en une vie d'quilibre et de beaut piliers de la justice et du droit. Contrairement l'humanisme d'aujourd'hui fond sur la ressemblance des visages et sur l'galit des existences, l'humanisme hellnique est fond sur la dissemblance. Dans l'humanisme moderne et postmoderne, toutes les vies humaines possdent la mme valeur ontologique, c'est--dire une valeur inhrente l'homme en tant qu'homme.",

      "numPages": 182,
      "description": "Roger L'Estrange (1616-1704) was one of the most remarkable, significant and colourful figures in seventeenth-century England. Whilst there has been regular, if often cursory, scholarly interest in his activities as Licenser and Stuart apologist, this is the first sustained book-length study of the man for almost a century. L'Estrange's engagement on the Royalist side during the Civil war, and his energetic pamphleteering for the return of the King in the months preceding the Restoration earned him a reputation as one of the most radical royalist apologists. As Licenser for the Press under Charles II, he was charged with preventing the printing and publication of dissenting writings; his additional role as Surveyor of the Press authorised him to search the premises of printers and booksellers on the mere suspicion of such activity. He was also a tireless pamphleteer, journalist, and controversialist in the conformist cause, all of which made him the bête noire of Whigs and non-conformists. This collection of essays by leading scholars of the period highlights the instrumental role L'Estrange played in the shaping of the political, literary, and print cultures of the Restoration period. Taking an interdisciplinary approach the volume covers all the major aspects of his career, as well as situating them in their broader historical and literary context. By examining his career in this way the book offers insights that will prove of worth to political, social, religious and cultural historians, as well as those interested in seventeenth-century literary and book history.",

Soon they fell in love and got married, but had to deal with Lupé’s complex health problems. She tried valiantly to fight off her ailments. Her faith in Jesus Christ sustained her through her pain. Pasco rounds out this intimate journal with a tender glimpse into his own emotions and insights as his wife passed into the presence of the Lord, Whom they both loved. He shares his heartfelt recollection and devotional sentiment and gives God the Father, through His Son, Jesus Christ, all the glory, for He sent Pasco this 4’11” American Indian woman who became the love of his life. She gave him a wakeup call and inspired him to turn his life over to the Lord and become Born Again. I’m 4’11” and Going to Heaven is written in memory of Lupé as she always used to say, “I’m 4’11” and I’m going to heaven!” Now Pasco feels he hears Lupé’s spirit saying, “I’m 4’11” and I’m IN heaven!”",

All seems perfect, until she learns that the network will be cancelling her show. To add insult to injury, when she returns home from work, she catches her man in bed with the hired help. Despite her personal problems, she’s determined to move on and find a new home for her show. She pitches it unsuccessfully to every network on her list, until she finally piques the interest of the cable network TiMax. The only problem is that the network is run by Langley Green, father of Tressa Green, who happens to be the fiancée of Tiffany’s high school crush, Kory Banks. Touted as the queen of L.A., Tressa not only wants to keep her man away from Tiffany, but she’s also going to see to it that Tiffany’s show never sees daylight again. With an undeniable attraction and a secretive lust brewing between them, Kory does everything in his power to resist the temptation. He pulls away from Tiffany and tries to focus on his fiancée, but it isn’t long before the drama hits the fan. Tressa’s schemes and manipulative devices to destroy Tiffany could cause her to lose more than she ever imagined.",

      "description": "This third edition text provides expanded material on the restricted three body problem and celestial mechanics. With each chapter containing new content, readers are provided with new material on reduction, orbifolds, and the regularization of the Kepler problem, all of which are provided with applications. The previous editions grew out of graduate level courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics given at several different universities. The courses took students who had some background in differential equations and lead them through a systematic grounding in the theory of Hamiltonian mechanics from a dynamical systems point of view. This text provides a mathematical structure of celestial mechanics ideal for beginners, and will be useful to graduate students and researchers alike. Reviews of the second edition: \"The primary subject here is the basic theory of Hamiltonian differential equations studied from the perspective of differential dynamical systems. The N-body problem is used as the primary example of a Hamiltonian system, a touchstone for the theory as the authors develop it. This book is intended to support a first course at the graduate level for mathematics and engineering students. ... It is a well-organized and accessible introduction to the subject ... . This is an attractive book ... .\" (William J. Satzer, The Mathematical Association of America, March, 2009) “The second edition of this text infuses new mathematical substance and relevance into an already modern classic ... and is sure to excite future generations of readers. ... This outstanding book can be used not only as an introductory course at the graduate level in mathematics, but also as course material for engineering graduate students. ... it is an elegant and invaluable reference for mathematicians and scientists with an interest in classical and celestial mechanics, astrodynamics, physics, biology, and related fields.” (Marian Gidea, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2010 d)",

The site of Naga ed-Deir, Egypt, is unusual for its continued use over a long period of time (c. 3500 BCE–650 CE). Burials in N 2000 and N 2500 date to the First Intermediate Period/Middle Kingdom and the Coptic era. In keeping with Reisner’s earlier publications of Naga ed-Deir, this volume presents artifacts in chapter-length studies devoted to a particular object type and includes a burial-by-burial description. The excavators’ original drawings, notes, and photographs are complemented by a contemporary analysis of the objects by experts in their subfields.",

      "description": "This volume contains the proceedings of the \"Conference on the (p,n) Reaction and the Nucleon-Nucleon Force\" held in Telluride, Colorado, March 29-31, 1979. The idea to hold this conference grew out of a program at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility to study the (p,n) reaction in the 50-200 MeV energy range. The first new Indiana data, in contrast to low energy data, showed features suggestive of a dominant one pion exchange interaction. It seemed desir able to review what was known about the fre·e and the effective nucleon-nucleon force and the connection between the low and high energy (p,n) data. Thus the conference was born. The following people served as the organizing committee: S. M. Austin, Michigan State University W. Bertozzi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology S. D. Bloom, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory C. C. Foster, Indiana University C. D. Goodman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (Conference Chairman) D. A. Lind, University of Colorado J. Rapaport, Ohio University G. R. Satch1er, Oak Ridge National Laboratory G. E. Walker, Indiana University R. L. Walter, Duke University and TUNL The sponsoring organizations were: Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, Durham, North Carolina Of course, the major credit for the success of the con ference must go to the speakers who diligently prepared their talks that are reproduced in this volume.",

(1) NHCs were found to be efficient catalysts for the [4+2] annulation of β-substituted nitroalkenes. The scope of Rauhut–Currier reaction was successfully extended to the most challenging β-substituted alkenes by this method; (2) Enals were successfully used for [4+2] annulations with azodicarboxylates catalyzed by NHC via γ-addition. Highly enantiopure tetrahydropyridazinones and γ-amino acid derivatives could be easily prepared by subsequent transformations of the resulting dihydropyridazinones. (4) The readily available α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids were first successfully employed to generate the α,β-unsaturated acyl azolium intermediates by using NHC for the enantioselective [3+2] and [3+3] annulations.",

Ko Tautoro, Te Pito o Toku Ao is Ngapuhi elder Hone Sadler's powerful account of the origins, history and culture of the Ngapuhi people - a profound introduction to the Sacred House of Puhi. Sadler illustrates the unbroken chain of Ngapuhi sovereignty by looking in-depth at his own hapu of Ngati Moerewa, Ngati Rangi and Ngai Tawake ki te Waoku of Tautoro and Mataraua. The narrative is told through weaving together karakia and whakapapa, histories and korero that have been part of the oral traditions of Ngapuhi's whanau, hapu and iwi and handed down through the generations on marae and other gathering places. Presented first to open the Ngapuhi's claim before the Waitangi Tribunal, Sadler's narrative is a powerful Maori oral account, presented here in te reo and English on facing pages, of the story of New Zealand's largest iwi.",

      "description": "A pro-p group is the inverse limit of some system of finite p-groups, that is, of groups of prime-power order where the prime - conventionally denoted p - is fixed. Thus from one point of view, to study a pro-p group is the same as studying an infinite family of finite groups; but a pro-p group is also a compact topological group, and the compactness works its usual magic to bring 'infinite' problems down to manageable proportions. The p-adic integers appeared about a century ago, but the systematic study of pro-p groups in general is a fairly recent development. Although much has been dis covered, many avenues remain to be explored; the purpose of this book is to present a coherent account of the considerable achievements of the last several years, and to point the way forward. Thus our aim is both to stimulate research and to provide the comprehensive background on which that research must be based. The chapters cover a wide range. In order to ensure the most authoritative account, we have arranged for each chapter to be written by a leading contributor (or contributors) to the topic in question. Pro-p groups appear in several different, though sometimes overlapping, contexts.",

The author then sets up the analytic foundations of the theory of p-adic Lie groups and develops the relation between p-adic Lie groups and their Lie algebras. The second part of the book contains, for the first time in a textbook, a detailed exposition of Lazard's algebraic approach to compact p-adic Lie groups, via his notion of a p-valuation, together with its application to the structure of completed group rings.",

      "description": "This research paper continues [15]. We begin with giving a profound overview of the structure of arbitrary simple groups and in particular of the simple locally finite groups and reduce their Sylow theory for the prime p to a quite famous conjecture by Prof. Otto H. Kegel (see [37], Theorem 2.4: \"Let the p-subgroup P be a p-uniqueness subgroup in the finite simple group S which belongs to one of the seven rank-unbounded families. Then the rank of S is bounded in terms of P.\") about the rank-unbounded ones of the 19 known families of finite simple groups. We introduce a new scheme to describe the 19 families, the family T of types, define the rank of each type, and emphasise the rôle of Kegel covers. This part presents a unified picture of known results whose proofs are by reference. Subsequently we apply new ideas to prove the conjecture for the alternating groups. Thereupon we are remembering Kegel covers and *-sequences. Next we suggest a way 1) and a way 2) how to prove and even how to optimise Kegel's conjecture step-by-step or peu à peu which leads to Conjecture 1, Conjecture 2 and Conjecture 3 thereby unifying Sylow theory in locally finite simple groups with Sylow theory in locally finite and p-soluble groups whose joint study directs Sylow theory in (locally) finite groups. For any unexplained terminology we refer to [15]. We then continue the program begun above to optimise along the way 1) the theorem about the first type \"An\" of infinite families of finite simple groups step-by-step to further types by proving it for the second type \"A = PSLn\". We start with proving Conjecture 2 about the General Linear Groups over (commutative) locally finite fields, stating that their rank is bounded in terms of their p-uniqueness, and then break down this insight to the Special Linear Groups and the Projective Special Linear (PSL) Groups over locally finite fields. We close with suggestions for future research -> regarding the remaining rank-unbounded types (the \"Classical Groups\") and the way 2), -> regarding (locally) finite and p-soluble groups, and -> regarding Cauchy's and Galois' contributions to Sylow theory in finite groups. We much hope to enthuse group theorists with them. We include the predecessor research paper [15] as an Appendix.",

      "description": "Numbers ... , natural, rational, real, complex, p-adic .... What do you know about p-adic numbers? Probably, you have never used any p-adic (nonrational) number before now. I was in the same situation few years ago. p-adic numbers were considered as an exotic part of pure mathematics without any application. I have also used only real and complex numbers in my investigations in functional analysis and its applications to the quantum field theory and I was sure that these number fields can be a basis of every physical model generated by nature. But recently new models of the quantum physics were proposed on the basis of p-adic numbers field Qp. What are p-adic numbers, p-adic analysis, p-adic physics, p-adic probability? p-adic numbers were introduced by K. Hensel (1904) in connection with problems of the pure theory of numbers. The construction of Qp is very similar to the construction of (p is a fixed prime number, p = 2,3,5, ... ,127, ... ). Both these number fields are completions of the field of rational numbers Q. But another valuation 1 . Ip is introduced on Q instead of the usual real valuation 1 . I· We get an infinite sequence of non isomorphic completions of Q : Q2, Q3, ... , Q127, ... , IR = Qoo· These fields are the only possibilities to com plete Q according to the famous theorem of Ostrowsky.",

      "description": "This volume contains the proceedings of the 2019 Lluís A. Santaló Summer School on $p$-Adic Analysis, Arithmetic and Singularities, which was held from June 24–28, 2019, at the Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo, Santander, Spain. The main purpose of the book is to present and analyze different incarnations of the local zeta functions and their multiple connections in mathematics and theoretical physics. Local zeta functions are ubiquitous objects in mathematics and theoretical physics. At the mathematical level, local zeta functions contain geometry and arithmetic information about the set of zeros defined by a finite number of polynomials. In terms of applications in theoretical physics, these functions play a central role in the regularization of Feynman amplitudes and Koba-Nielsen-type string amplitudes, among other applications. This volume provides a gentle introduction to a very active area of research that lies at the intersection of number theory, $p$-adic analysis, algebraic geometry, singularity theory, and theoretical physics. Specifically, the book introduces $p$-adic analysis, the theory of Archimedean, $p$-adic, and motivic zeta functions, singularities of plane curves and their Poincaré series, among other similar topics. It also contains original contributions in the aforementioned areas written by renowned specialists. This book is an important reference for students and experts who want to delve quickly into the area of local zeta functions and their many connections in mathematics and theoretical physics.",

      "description": "P’ansori is the quintessential traditional Korean musical drama, in which epic tales are sung and narrated by a solo singer accompanied by a drummer. Drawing on her extensive research in Korea and its diasporas, Haekyung Um describes and analyses the creative processes of p’ansori, weaving into her discussion musical, social and cultural aspects that include the evolution of p’ansori performance, origins and historical development, textual and musical materials, stylistic features of different p’ansori schools, transmission of knowledge, aesthetics, and changing interpretations of tradition. Also explored is the complexity of historical and contemporary influences that give shape to p’ansori as a ‘living tradition’ across the ages and into the present, and as a cultural icon with an enduring narrative and emotional impact. Social, economic and political dynamics are created in the nexus of traditional feudal values, colonial modernity and nationalism. The impact of aspects of late modernity such as technology, mass media, migration and globalization, has transported p’ansori into digital and transnational domains. By bringing all these creative and contextual processes together, Haekyung Um explains how a tradition is created, maintained and redefined by the dynamic interactions of agents, values, meanings, strategies, identities and artistic hybridity.",

      "description": "Known for the distinctive 'sharkmouth' decoration on their noses, P-40 fighters first saw combat in China during World War II. Their most common adversary was the Japanese Nakajima Ki-43, nicknamed 'Oscar.' Carl Molesworth describes and explains the design and development of these two foes, the products of two vastly different philosophies of fighter design. The P-40 was heavily armed and sturdy with armour protection and self-sealing fuel tanks, but paid for this with the loss of speed and a sluggish performance at altitude. The Ki-43 was a rapier to the battleaxe P-40 and the Ki-43 was immensely nimble, though with less firepower and durability. This book examines these two different fighters, and the pilots who flew them over China, with an action-packed text, rare photographs and digital artwork.",

      "description": "To date, the theoretical development of q-calculus has rested on a non-uniform basis. Generally, the bulky Gasper-Rahman notation was used, but the published works on q-calculus looked different depending on where and by whom they were written. This confusion of tongues not only complicated the theoretical development but also contributed to q-calculus remaining a neglected mathematical field. This book overcomes these problems by introducing a new and interesting notation for q-calculus based on logarithms.For instance, q-hypergeometric functions are now visually clear and easy to trace back to their hypergeometric parents. With this new notation it is also easy to see the connection between q-hypergeometric functions and the q-gamma function, something that until now has been overlooked. The book covers many topics on q-calculus, including special functions, combinatorics, and q-difference equations. Apart from a thorough review of the historical development of q-calculus, this book also presents the domains of modern physics for which q-calculus is applicable, such as particle physics and supersymmetry, to name just a few.​",

The International Q Project's presentation of the critical text of Q 12:33-34, together with the exhaustive history of research on which it is based, will considerably enhance research in the Sayings Gospel Q, the historical Jesus, and the ethical concerns of early Jesus movements.",

For that reason an understanding of Q and its variation with position in the earth and with time should provide information on earth's tectonic evolution, as well as on aspects of its internal structure. Papers of this volume present new information on Q in the earth from several perspectives: methodology, results from global and regional observations of both body and surface waves, laboratory measurements, and theoretical understanding. The editors believe that the present volume reaches a new threshold in Q studies and that advances in data quality and methodology will spur increased interest in this difficult, but interesting field.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

      "description": "R Visualizations: Derive Meaning from Data focuses on one of the two major topics of data analytics: data visualization, a.k.a., computer graphics. In the book, major R systems for visualization are discussed, organized by topic and not by system. Anyone doing data analysis will be shown how to use R to generate any of the basic visualizations with the R visualization systems. Further, this book introduces the author’s lessR system, which always can accomplish a visualization with less coding than the use of other systems, sometimes dramatically so, and also provides accompanying statistical analyses. Key Features Presents thorough coverage of the leading R visualization system, ggplot2. Gives specific guidance on using base R graphics to attain visualizations of the same quality as those provided by ggplot2. Shows how to create a wide range of data visualizations: distributions of categorical and continuous variables, many types of scatterplots including with a third variable, time series, and maps. Inclusion of the various approaches to R graphics organized by topic instead of by system. Presents the recent work on interactive visualization in R. David W. Gerbing received his PhD from Michigan State University in 1979 in quantitative analysis, and currently is a professor of quantitative analysis in the School of Business at Portland State University. He has published extensively in the social and behavioral sciences with a focus on quantitative methods. His lessR package has been in development since 2009.",

      "description": "Initially developed by Savoia-Marchetti as a transport, the aircraft had evolved into a dedicated medium bomber by the time the S.79-I made its combat debut in the Spanish Civil War in 1936. During World War 2, it became Italy's most successful bomber, and the most produced, with around 1370 built between 1936 and early 1944. Although initially hampered by poor tactics, the S.79 bomber crews nonetheless scored sunk a number of Allied vessels, and provided a constant threat to Allied sailors in the Mediterranean in the early stages of the war. In East Africa and the Red Sea the Sparvieri were the most modern bombers in-theatre, proving a challenge to RAF and SAAF biplane fighters. Using specially commissioned full-colour artwork, first-hand accounts and historic photographs, this volume chronicles the history of the S.79's war in the Mediterranean, North African, Balkan, and East African theatres.",

In that regard, senior executives attached particular importance to the budding United Nations organization, a transnational institution which notably President Truman viewed as one of the seminal centrepieces of world peace and security. Two vital speeches delivered by Truman in the spring and early summer of 1945 amply reflected this sentiment.",

The first part covers data input/output, calculation of commonly used indexes and plotting in R. The core of the book then focusses on the presentation and practical implementations of modelling techniques used for fingerprinting processes such as partial melting, fractional crystallization, binary mixing or AFC using major-, trace-element and radiogenic isotope data. The reader will be given a firm theoretical basis for forward/reverse modelling, followed by exercises dealing with typical problems likely to be encountered in real life, and their solutions using R. The concluding sections demonstrate, using practical examples, how a researcher can proceed in developing a realistic model simulating natural systems. The appendices outline the fundamentals of the R language and provide a quick introduction to the open-source R-package GCDkit for interpretation of whole-rock geochemical data from igneous and metamorphic rocks.",

Adding to the difficulty is that most modelers learn the steps involved in cleaning and managing data piecemeal, often on the fly, or they develop their own ad hoc methods. This book helps simplify their task by providing a unified, systematic approach to acquiring, modeling, manipulating, cleaning, and maintaining data in R. Starting with the very basics, data scientists Samuel E. Buttrey and Lyn R. Whitaker walk readers through the entire process. From what data looks like and what it should look like, they progress through all the steps involved in getting data ready for modeling. They describe best practices for acquiring data from numerous sources; explore key issues in data handling, including text/regular expressions, big data, parallel processing, merging, matching, and checking for duplicates; and outline highly efficient and reliable techniques for documenting data and recordkeeping, including audit trails, getting data back out of R, and more. The only single-source guide to R data and its preparation, it describes best practices for acquiring, manipulating, cleaning, and maintaining data Begins with the basics and walks readers through all the steps necessary to get data ready for the modeling process Provides expert guidance on how to document the processes described so that they are reproducible Written by seasoned professionals, it provides both introductory and advanced techniques Features case studies with supporting data and R code, hosted on a companion website A Data Scientist's Guide to Acquiring, Cleaning and Managing Data in R is a valuable working resource/bench manual for practitioners who collect and analyze data, lab scientists and research associates of all levels of experience, and graduate-level data mining students.",

      "description": "Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis {Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.",

      "description": "Treating older children and adolescents who have difficulty correctly producing /r/ sounds remains an ongoing source of frustration for many clinicians. The new professional resource Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists provides the most up-to-date information on the current understanding of /r/ and the related errors, along with a range of treatment options, to offer a comprehensive tool for Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) treating this complex issue. In addition to a discussion of traditional articulation therapy and ways to improve the administration of this technique, this practical text offers a detailed review and explanation of several very promising alternative approaches. Written in what has been described as Dr. Flipsen's \"folksy\" style, this text is designed for the busy clinician. The first five chapters of Remediation of /r/ for Speech-Language Pathologists delve into the basic information needed to treat /r/. The next six chapters each tackle a specific treatment option. The treatment section begins with a re-examination of traditional articulation therapy and uses research evidence to help clinicians to fine-tune its application. It then progresses to discussing more significant modifications to traditional therapy and introduces several newer approaches to modifying the feedback being provided to the client. For each treatment option, the author presents a solid rationale and the latest evidence, along with practical strategies for their implementation. The final chapter discusses methods for deciding which remediation method to choose when working with /r/ errors.",

      "description": "When it was introduced into service in 1953, the T-10 represented a return to the “classic” Soviet heavy tank. Although considered a major threat to NATO tank forces, it also represented the end of an era. All gun heavy tanks like the T-10 would eventually be made effectively redundant by later models like the T-62 which had powerful next generation armament and new ammunition types. The tank was gradually withdrawn from service in the 1970s, though the last tanks would only leave Russian service, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation, in 1997. As such the T-10 outlived the Soviet state that had created it. Never exported outside of the Soviet Union and rarely used in combat, the T-10 has remained a mysterious tank, with many of its variants unknown in the West until very recently. This study, written from original Russian and Ukrainian primary source documents that have only recently been made available, uncovers the history of this enigmatic tank using 130 stunning contemporary and modern photographs of the T-10 as well as full colour side-view artwork.",

The good-natured Barnes runs into one problem: everyone, including the middle school’s basketball coach, assumes that since he is African American and from the inner city, he must be great at basketball and can save the school team’s season. Unfortunately, Barnes is not an athlete, and contrary to assumptions about black kids, he’s terrible at basketball! Trouble arises when the school discovers that Lunch Money Can’t Shoot!",

He also represented an insurance company that smelled a rat about a traffic-accident claim. The trouble was the claimant had drifted away - a beautiful blonde who had been co-operative and level-headed. In fact, too level-headed ... she sounded almost professional. Donald Lam didn't like it. Why should a large insurance company need an outside investigator? But Bertha's eyes see $$$ so Donald gets cracking, and within no time he is the prime suspect. For what on earth is a body doing in the trunk of Donald's car?",

This is the true story of how I didn't die. High school sucks for a lot of people. High school extra sucks when you believe, deep in your soul, that every kid in the school is out to get you. I wasn't popular before I got locked up in Straight Inc., the notorious \"tough love\" program for troubled teens. So it's not like I was walking around thinking everyone liked me. But when you're psychologically beaten for sixteen months, you start to absorb the lessons. The lessons in Straight were: You are evil. Your peers are evil. Everything is evil except Straight, Inc. Before long, you're a true believer. And when you're finally released, sent back into the world, you crave safety. Crave being back in the warehouse. And if you can't be there, you'd rather be dead.",

      "description": "Unlike most t'ai chi books, which focus strictly on how to do the t'ai chi forms, T'ai Chi as a Path of Wisdom presents a personal, practical view of this intriguing martial art. Lehrhaupt shares illuminating stories from her own life and the lives of her students that show how t'ai chi can be a vehicle for profound self-discovery and spiritual growth. In learning to master each body posture, t'ai chi students often confront self-doubt, frustration, and the desire to compete and compare themselves to others—problems that also arise in daily life. Lehrhaupt shows how these and other obstacles provide valuable opportunities to deepen awareness and recognize the striking continuities between practice and everyday life. Each section of the book includes practical exercises designed to enhance students' understanding of t'ai chi movements, and a helpful appendix answers many frequently asked questions about t'ai chi training such as how to find a teacher and how to balance practice with family life. Full of useful insights and guidance, T'ai Chi as a Path of Wisdom will be a valuable companion for all students of this increasingly popular martial art.",

Helen Gamlen isn't sure anything has, but when Martin Andras turns up unannounced on her doorstep one night, implying that her aunt has disappeared, she feels she should try to clear things up once and for all. Martin's interest in Violet's fate is purely selfish: her house in Burnstone had belonged to his grandfather, who left it to his faithful housekeeper for her lifetime. When she dies it will return to Martin's mother, and later, of course, to him. But when Helen arrives on her aunt's doorstep, she finds she isn't the only person looking for a missing lady . . .",

Detective Finn Wight has been working Gerald’s case from the beginning. He refuses to drop it now, even though it is out of his jurisdiction. He keeps Jemima apprised of all his findings, no matter how painful. Defending her ‘innocent’ clients fills Jemima’s days. Finn’s muscular frame and easy smile fills her fantasies. But nothing relieves the guilt. Guilt that she couldn’t prevent Gerald’s devolution from genius scientist, to absent-minded professor, to ‘bat-shit crazy’ at the hands of paranoid schizophrenia. Guilt that, not long after his death, she was finding solace, and happiness, in the arms of another man. Feeding homeless in a local park helps ease Jemima’s pain. When a new ‘resident’ shows up, the others are wary. Though he refuses to speak, something in his eyes tells Jemima that he doesn’t belong there — that someone is looking for him. Jemima and Finn join forces to discover the man’s identity. They uncover the secret that sent him running from home, but there is so much that even he doesn’t know. Will the truth send him over the edge for good? Or can Jemima bring him back to reality? Bring him home? Before it is too late.",

      "description": "A timely and applied approach to the newly discovered methods and applications of U-statistics Built on years of collaborative research and academic experience, Modern Applied U-Statistics successfully presents a thorough introduction to the theory of U-statistics using in-depth examples and applications that address contemporary areas of study including biomedical and psychosocial research. Utilizing a \"learn by example\" approach, this book provides an accessible, yet in-depth, treatment of U-statistics, as well as addresses key concepts in asymptotic theory by integrating translational and cross-disciplinary research. The authors begin with an introduction of the essential and theoretical foundations of U-statistics such as the notion of convergence in probability and distribution, basic convergence results, stochastic Os, inference theory, generalized estimating equations, as well as the definition and asymptotic properties of U-statistics. With an emphasis on nonparametric applications when and where applicable, the authors then build upon this established foundation in order to equip readers with the knowledge needed to understand the modern-day extensions of U-statistics that are explored in subsequent chapters. Additional topical coverage includes: Longitudinal data modeling with missing data Parametric and distribution-free mixed-effect and structural equation models A new multi-response based regression framework for non-parametric statistics such as the product moment correlation, Kendall's tau, and Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank tests A new class of U-statistic-based estimating equations (UBEE) for dependent responses Motivating examples, in-depth illustrations of statistical and model-building concepts, and an extensive discussion of longitudinal study designs strengthen the real-world utility and comprehension of this book. An accompanying Web site features SAS? and S-Plus? program codes, software applications, and additional study data. Modern Applied U-Statistics accommodates second- and third-year students of biostatistics at the graduate level and also serves as an excellent self-study for practitioners in the fields of bioinformatics and psychosocial research.",

      "description": "A unique introduction to the constitutional arguments for and against the right to abortion In January 1973, the Supreme Court’s opinion in Roe v. Wade struck down most of the country's abortion laws and held for the first time that the Constitution guarantees women the right to safe and legal abortions. Nearly five decades later, in 2022, the Court’s 5-4 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overturned Roe and eliminated the constitutional right, stunning the nation. Instead of finally resolving the constitutional issues, Dobbs managed to bring new attention to them while sparking a debate about the Supreme Court’s legitimacy. Originally published in 2005, What Roe v. Wade Should Have Said asked eleven distinguished constitutional scholars to rewrite the opinions in this landmark case in light of thirty years’ experience but making use only of sources available at the time of the original decision. Offering the best arguments for and against the constitutional right to abortion, the contributors have produced a series of powerful essays that get to the heart of this fascinating case. In addition, Jack Balkin gives a detailed historical introduction that chronicles the Roe litigation—and the constitutional and political clashes that followed it—and explains the Dobbs decision and its aftermath.",

Cases in each volume are listed in the prefatory table. The United States Tax Court is a federal trial court of record established by Congress under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, section 8 providing (in part) that Congress has the power to \"constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court. “The Tax Court specializes in adjudicating disputes over federal income tax, generally prior to the time at which formal tax assessments are made by the Internal Revenue Service. Though taxpayers may choose to litigate tax matters in a variety of legal settings, outside of bankruptcy, the Tax Court is the only forum in which taxpayers may do so without having first paid the disputed tax in full. Parties who contest the imposition of a tax may also bring an action in any United States District Court, or in the United States Court of Federal Claims; however these venues require that the tax be paid first, and that the party then file a lawsuit to recover the contested amount paid (the \"full payment rule”).” Contents 8 Findings of Fact 8 Background 8 John Hancock’s History9 Investment Process and Review10 Leasing10 LILO and SILO Transactions 10 Basic Structure 15 History 17 Due Diligence 18 The Hoosier Transaction 19 The LILO Test Transactions 20 OBB LILO20 Lease and Sublease23 End of Sublease Term25 SNCB 2 and SNCB 5 Lot 1 LILO Transactions25 Lease and Sublease28 End of Sublease Term 28 The SILO Test Transactions 29 TIWAG29 Lease and Sublease33 End of Sublease Term35 Two Dortmund Transactions35 Lease and Sublease38 End of Sublease39 SNCB SILO39 Grant and Subgrant42 End of Subgrant Term 43 Tax Returns, Notices of Deficiency, and Trial 43 Procedural History48 Trial 53 Opinion 53 Burden of Proof53 Principal Place of Business54 Leveraged Lease Transactions54 Frank Lyon58 LILO and SILO Litigation 77 The Test Transactions 78 Economic Substance79 Objective Inquiry88 Subjective Inquiry89 Substance Over Form91 OBB and SNCB LILO Transactions110 SILO Test Transactions 145 Interest Deductions 147 Original Issue Discount 149 Transaction Expenses 149 Conclusion NOTE: NO FURTHER DISCOUNTS FOR ALREADY REDUCED SALE ITEMS.

      "description": "This is the first intermediate-student edition of a selection from Apuleius' Metamorphoses V. Sections 11–24 are included as Latin text with an accompanying commentary and vocabulary. Focusing on a deliberately concise extract from the original, this edition is designed to be manageable for students reading the text for the first time while also perfectly encapsulating the interest of the longer work and inspiring further study of it. A detailed introduction explains points of literary and stylistic interest, encompassing the beginning of the story, from Metamorphoses IV, section 28. Apuleius is considered one of the great Latin stylists. The tale of Cupid and Psyche, a story set within the larger narrative of his novel, the Metamorphoses, follows the romance of the god of love, Cupid, and his mortal lover, Psyche, brought to disaster by the wiles of Psyche's wicked sisters and the anger of Venus, but eventually reconciled. It is both an adventure story, and an allegory for the relationship between the soul and desire. The selection here contains some of the most hauntingly beautiful Latin prose which has come down to us and gives an unparallelled insight into the relationship between philosophy, religion, and art under the high empire.",

      "description": "The leading edge of computer science research is notoriously ?ckle. New trends come and go with alarming and unfailing regularity. In such a rapidly changing ?eld, the fact that research interest in a subject lasts more than a year is worthy of note. The fact that, after ?ve years, interest not only remains, but actually continues to grow is highly unusual. As 1998 marked the ?fth birthday of the International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL), it seemed appropriate for the organizers of the original workshop to comment on this remarkable growth, and re ect on how the ?eld has developed and matured. The ?rst ATAL workshop was co-located with the Eleventh European Conference on Arti?cial Intelligence (ECAI-94), which was held in Amsterdam. The fact that we chose an AI conference to co-locate with is telling: at that time, we expected most researchers with an interest in agents to come from the AI community. The workshop, whichwasplannedoverthesummerof1993,attracted32submissions,andwasattended by 55 people.ATAL was the largest workshop at ECAI-94, and the clear enthusiasm on behalfofthecommunitymadethedecisiontoholdanotherATALworkshopsimple.The ATAL-94proceedingswereformallypublishedinJanuary1995underthetitleIntelligent Agents, and included an extensive review article, a glossary, a list of key agent systems, and — unusually for the proceedings of an academic workshop — a full subject index. Thehighscienti?candproductionvaluesembodiedbytheATAL-94proceedingsappear to have been recognized by the community, and resulted inATAL proceedings being the most successful sequence of books published in Springer-Verlag s Lecture Notes in Arti?cial Intelligence series.",

      "description": "The final volume in the Handbook for Liturgical Studies series, Volume V: Liturgical Time and Space contains the concluding material for an integral study of the liturgy. It opens with a preliminary notion of time and space, before discussing in detail three types of liturgical celebrations on which time and space have a direct and particular bearing. The first of these is the Liturgy of the Hours. This topic is developed in the light of the early Christian tradition until the fourth century and its subsequent forms in both East and West. The second is the Liturgical Year, traditionally called the anni circulas. The development of the Liturgical Year during the first four centuries is reviewed. This is followed by adetaled study of the Byzantine, Roman, and non-Roman Western tradition. It concludes with the theology and spirituality of the Liturgical Year wherein the mystery of Christ as a saving event is made present in time, so that the faithful may lay hold of it through the Word and the sacraments. The theology of liturgical space is drawn from the mutual interaction between the assembled community, which gives meaning to the place of assembly, and the place itself, which upholds and signifies community.

      "description": "In English translation. One of the most talked-about works ever published in the German Democratic Republic! This innovative novel by an East German writer is a worthy companion to the classic it parodies and parallels: Goethes The Sufferings of Young Werther. Goethe and J. D. Salinger were the two greatest influences on Edgar Wibeau, Young W. Edgar is a 17-year-old with the frustrations of teenagers all over the world, living with the added pressures of an East-bloc state. A model all-GDR boy, the son of a factory director, he suddenly drops out. But not from socialism per sejust from conformity, picky regulations, and official disapproval of jeans, the blues, and girls. Hiding out, he finds and devours an old copy of The Sufferings of Young Werther. From then on he wards off reality with Goethe texts, and young Wibeaus fate is superimposed on that of Werther like a transparent overlay. It is an ironic and revealing linkage.",

Enzo Ferrari was born in Modena, Italy, to a family with a metal-fabricating shop, fostering his interest in mechanics over academics.

      "description": "What does it mean to be Black in an anti-Black world? In Black X: Liberatory Thought in Azania, Tendayi Sithole offers a compelling example of how to engage South Africa differently. Set in the Black point of view as a site of critical reflection, he confronts the question of colonial conquest, social cohesion and justice. Since South Africa is a name given to the country by its conquerors, not by its indigenous inhabitants, for true liberation, a renaming needs to occur. The concept of Azania holds this emancipatory gesture. The post conquest, post 1994 liberal narratives mute the prevalence of racism while valorizing non-racialism and the transcendence of race. To indicate this silencing, the book deploys the concept of X, both as a signifier of repression and dehumanization of the Black subject, and as an empty signifier that holds the opportunity for radical and compassionate rehumanization. The book examines these strands of erasure and hope for the Black subject. Sithole scrutinizes the colonial contract, arguing that it is not a contract since there has never been an agreement between the indigenous people and the settler colonialists. This brings into focus the land question, specifically land dispossession and its existential connection to black life. The relevance of Black Consciousness to the Azanian existential tradition is based on Steve Biko’s case that Marxism ignores Black ontological misery through its valorization of class and failure to include anti-Black racism in its analysis of power. Finally, Sithole analyses Mabogo P. More’s philosophical meditations around what it means to be Black in an anti-Black world. In erasing the idea of South Africa and inscribing an open-ended naming of X, the book opens the way for something new to take its place that is imbued with greater humanity. This gesture opens up the potential to think about liberation in this country that is yet to rename and redefine itself.",

En que este es el \"tiempo de la verdad\" y que no podemos darnos el lujo de seguir viviendo una vida engaЦada, equivocada, llena de dudas, confusiones; en oscurantismo, e ignorando el verdadero propЧsito establecido por Dios, con relaciЧn al hombre, y en especial a su iglesia. Y que en este libro encontrarЗn mucha claridad de los acontecimientos del fin, que los podrЗn sacar de los laberintos de ti nieblas elaborados por SatanЗs. Y 2...Que: tengamos claridad en lo que concierne con el propЧsito de YahvО Dios con relaciЧn al acto mЗs importante de nuestra redenciЧn, rescate y de nuestra salvaciЧn. Y Para ello tener la plena seguridad y conocimiento de lo que es, y la importancia que tiene la Iglesia de Jesucristo con relaciЧn a la iglesia del Anticristo, o gran Ramera como la apellida la palabra de Dios. 3... Y sobre todas las cosas: que anhelemos este dТa glorioso de la segunda venida de Nuestro SeЦor Jesucristo, para que terminando con la iniquidad, la maldad desaparezca por completo hasta los confines de la tierra; y que todos estemos preparados para cuando suene la final trompeta, seamos traspuestos \"en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, para reunirnos con el SeЦor en el Aire\".

El estudio se centra en el intercambio comercial con Nueva España y los vericuetos de la prohibición comercial entre colonias. Muestra, por una parte, el carácter imperialista de la corona que gobernó sus posesiones del Nuevo Mundo como colonias más que como reinos en el aspecto económico, aunque una de las primeras cosas que el tráfico del cacao puso en evidencia es que la prohibición de la Corona del siglo XVII no detuvo la exportación de cacao, aunque sí frenó el crecimiento de Guayaquil. Por otra parte, la investigación establece el tráfico naviero, los montos de las cargas de cacao que arribaron a Acapulco y las manifestaciones de los precios en el mercado de la ciudad de México y trata de demostrar que la oferta creciente de cacao guayaquil, ayudó a mantener los precios estables en un contexto general de crecimiento de los precios en la segunda parte del siglo XVIII.",

      "description": "Edition and translation of this important genre of Old Welsh poetry.The \"Stanzas of the Graves\" or \"Graves of the Warriors of the Island of Britain\", attributed to the legendary poet Taliesin, describe ancient heroes' burial places. Like the \"Triads of the Island of Britain\", they are an indispensable key to the narrative literature of medieval Wales. The heroes come from the whole of Britain, including Mercia and present-day Scotland, as well as many from Wales and a few from Ireland. Many characters known from the Mabinogion appear, often with additional information, as do some from romance and early Welsh saga, such as Arthur, Bedwyr, Gawain, Owain son of Urien, Merlin, and Vortigern. The seventh-century grave of Penda of Mercia, beneath the river Winwæd in Yorkshire, is the latest grave to be included. The poems testify to the interest aroused by megaliths, tumuli, and other apparently man-made monuments, some of which can be identified with known prehistoric remains.This volume offers a full edition and translation of the poems, mapped with reference to all the manuscripts, starting with the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest extant book of Welsh poetry. There is also a detailed commentary on their linguistic, literary, historical, and archaeological aspects. translation of the poems, mapped with reference to all the manuscripts, starting with the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest extant book of Welsh poetry.

Soon as the groom arrives into The Netherlands for a family reunion, he shockingly discovers in her a spoilt woman. The man tries to save his bond of marriage but the wronged woman neither wants to be tamed due to aspects of love, nor does she co-operate. Instead, she rather wants her man to close his eyes and to shut up his mouth if ever he wishes to become a legitimate resident in her country. The egoist man doesnt compromise on self-respect of a saintly husband and thus is thrown out into streets quite empty-handed and undocumented. Then he gets afraid of going back to his homeland predicting a social ridiculous. Years passed in such a dreary and stoned life-style that one day the city police arrests him against his unlawful status and surrenders him to the foreign police who when fails to deport, sets him free like a squeezed lemon after he having served a years custodial sentence. The author describes how a few Asian immigrants and their spoiled descendants who once get settled into the Western states . forget about their past of struggling. . trap and bait to their own continent/ country-fellows by showing on them a false fairyland. . and try to demoralize a Western society by using its culture as a shield or weapon to fulfill their own sensual curiosity which seems difficult to meet in their own sender lands. The author also regrets to inflexibility of the constitution and rejects to the old theory nobody is above law. He urges on the law-makers must to defend on humanitarian grounds to those noble outlanders who become illegal by some accident, or by a misfortune befell on them and not by fraud or cheating like do often the professional invaders or regular tress-passers breaking into some countrys barriers. The whole story convincingly draws a picture of human courage and endurance against all odds mixed in shadow of oppression and optimism by giving an entire message never quit. A compulsively true heart saga with a positive energy_ readable, thought-provoking and enjoyable.",

      "description": "Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was undoubtedly one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century, and perhaps of any century. He was also a fascinating, charismatic, and irritating man. His philosophical ability was recognized almost immediately by Bertrand Russell, and during his lifetime his work influenced first logical positivism and then ordinary language philosophy. Since then it has also become central in post-analytical philosophical thought. Beyond the world of academic philosophy it has inspired playwrights, poets, novelists, architects, filmmakers, and biographers. The A to Z of Wittgenstein's Philosophy is intended for anyone who wants to know more about the philosophy and the life of this enigmatic thinker. The book contains an introductory overview of his life and work, a timeline of the major relevant events in and after his life, an extensive bibliography, and, above all, an A-Z of ideas, people, and places that have been involved in his philosophy and its reception. The dictionary is written with no particular agenda and includes entries on philosophers (and others) who influenced Wittgenstein, those he influenced in turn, and some of the main figures in contemporary Wittgenstein scholarship. Suggestions for further reading are also included, as well as a guide to the literature on Wittgenstein and a bibliography broken down by subject area.",

He then achieved success as a businessman, an activist, and an author, while staying true to the spirit of hip-hop.Raised in Brooklyn, New York, Jay-Z grew up in a household full of music lovers. After hearing people rap for the first time, he also discovered the creative fire within himself.

      "description": "Nissan Z: 50 Years of Exhilarating Performance is the Nissan-official chronicle of Z history, from Datsun's planning for the new model in the late 1960s through the latest 50th anniversary Nissan 370Z. The Datsun 240Z revolutionized the sports car industry and demolished established assumptions about Japanese automakers. With the Z, Datsun gave the world a sleek, sexy, fast product—one that forever banished the idea that Japanese manufacturers could only build economy cars. Over the past 50 years, six generations of the Z car have generated a massive, devoted following. More than 1.5 million cars have been sold worldwide. The retro-inspired 350Z reinvigorated the Z’s fortunes in the 21st century, and the latest incarnation, the 370Z, continues the tradition of high-performance in a modern, affordable package. In addition to a complete history of the Z, this handsomely illustrated book examines the car's significant racing history with successes in IMSA and SCCA sports car racing, including extensive racing by Paul Newman for Bob Sharp and John Morton with Brock Racing Enterprises. Special attention is devoted to the cult of Z-fans around the world who have supported Nissan's sports car through thick and thin and the early car’s emergence as a rapidly appreciating collector car. The story is told by author Pete Evanow, who has enjoyed a long relationship with Nissan. His insights into the history of this automotive icon provide a fresh, compelling perspective on the five decades of the Z that no enthusiast will want to miss.",

      "description": "Postmodernist literature embraces a wide range of forms and perspectives, including texts that are primarily self-reflexive; texts that use pastiche, burlesque, parody, intertextuality and hybrid forms to create textual realities that either run in opposition to or in parallel with an external reality; fabulations that develop both of these strategies; texts that ironize their relationship to reality; works that use the aspects already noted to more fully engage with political or cultural realities; texts that deal with history as a fiction; and texts that elude categorization even within the variety already explored. For example, in fiction, a postmodernist novel might tell a story about a writer struggling with writing (only, perhaps, to find that he is a character in a book by another writer struggling to write a book). The A to Z of Postmodernist Literature and Theater examines the different areas of postmodernist literature and the variety of forms that have been produced. This is accomplished through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and several hundred cross-referenced dictionary entries on individual postmodernist writers, the important postmodernist aesthetic practices, significant texts produced throughout the history of postmodernist writing, and important movements and ideas that have created a variety of literary approaches within the form. By placing these concerns within the historical, philosophical, and cultural contexts of postmodernism, this reference explores the frameworks within which postmodernist literature of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century operates.",

      "description": "The z/OS® Distributed File Service zSeries® File System (zFS) is a z/OS UNIX® file system that can be used like the Hierarchical File System (HFS). zFS file systems contain files and directories, including Access Control Lists (ACLs), that can be accessed with the z/OS HFS application programming interfaces (APIs). zFS file systems can be mounted into the z/OS UNIX hierarchy along with other local or remote file system types (for example, HFS, TFS, AUTOMNT, NFS, and so on). zFS does not replace HFS, but it is the z/OS UNIX strategic file system and IBM® recommends migrating HFS file systems to zFS. Beginning with z/OS V1R7, there are no restrictions for file system structures that should be kept as HFS instead of zFS. This IBM Redbooks® publication helps you to install, tailor, and configure new zFS file systems. This information can be used by system administrators who work with the zFS component of the IBM z/OS Distributed File Service base element. The book provides a broad description of the new architecture of the zFS file system for all releases up to zFS V1R13. You can use it as a reference when converting HFS file systems to zFS file systems. It will help you to create a solution for migrating to zFS file systems, and to understand the performance differences between HFS file systems and zFS file systems.",

Just how successful the UN has been in maintaining these goals is covered in The A to Z of the United Nations.

      "description": "The Z notation has been developed at the Programming Research Group at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory and elsewhere for over a decade. It is now used by industry as part of the software (and hardware) development process in both Europe and the USA. It is currently undergoing BSI standardisation in the UK, and has been proposed for ISO standardisation internationally. In recent years researchers have begun to focus increasingly on the development of techniques and tools to encourage the wider application of Z and other formal methods and notations. This volume contains papers from the Seventh Annual Z User Meeting, held in London in December 1992. In contrast to previous years the meeting concentrated specifically on industrial applications of Z, and a high proportion of the participants came from an industrial background. The theme is well represented by the four invited papers. Three of these discuss ways in which formal methods are being introduced, and the fourth presents an international survey of industrial applications. It also provides a reminder of the improvements which are needed to make these methods an accepted part of software development. In addition the volume contains several submitted papers on the industrial use of Z, two of which discuss the key area of safety-critical applications. There are also a number of papers related to the recently-completed ZIP project. The papers cover all the main areas of the project including methods, tools, and the development of a Z Standard, the first publicly-available version of which was made available at the meeting. Finally the volume contains a select Z bibliography, and section on how to access information on Z through comp.specification.z, the international, computer-based USENET newsgroup. Z User Workshop, London 1992 provides an important overview of current research into industrial applications of Z, and will provide invaluable reading for researchers, postgraduate students and also potential industrial users of Z.",

      "description": "This IBM® Redbooks® publication is Volume 2 of a five-volume series of books entitled The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z®. This volume includes the following chapters: Chapter 1, \"Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on LNXADMIN\" on page 3, describes how to install and configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux onto the Linux Administration server, which performs the cloning and other tasks. Chapter 2, \"Automated Red Hat Enterprise Linux installations by using Kickstart\" on page 37, describes how to use Red Hat's kickstart tool to create Linux systems. This tool is fundamentally different from cloning in that an automated installation is implemented. You can try kickstart and cloning. Understand that these applications attempt to accomplish the same goal of quickly getting Linux systems up and running, and that you do not need to use both. Chapter 3, \"Working with subscription-manager, yum, and DaNdiFied\" on page 47, describes how the Red Hat Network works. It provides centralized management and provisioning for multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. Kickstart is an easy and fast way to provision your Linux guests in any supported Linux platform. It re-creates the operating system from the beginning by using the kickstart profile configuration file that installs the new operating system unattended. It also sets up the new guest according to the definition that was set up in the kickstart file. Usually, Linux is administered by the same team that manages Linux on all platforms. By using kickstart, you can create a basic profile that can be used in all supported platforms and customize Linux profiles, as needed. Cloning requires a better understanding of the z/VM environment and z/VM skills. It is a fast process if you enable the IBM FlashCopy® feature in advance. It clones the disks from a golden image to new disks that are used by the new Linux guest. The process can be automated by using the cloning scripts that are supplied with this book. It is recommended that you start with The Virtualization Cookbook for IBM Z Volume 1: IBM z/VM 7.2, SG24-8147 of this series because the IBM® z/VM hypervisor is the foundation (or base \"layer\") for installing Linux on IBM Z.",

      "description": "IBM® DB2® buffer pools are still a key resource for ensuring good performance. This has become increasingly important as the difference between processor speed and disk response time for a random access I/O widens in each new generation of processor. An IBM System z® processor can be configured with large amounts of storage, which if used wisely, can help compensate by using storage to avoid synchronous I/O. Several changes in buffer pool management have been provided by DB2 10 and DB2 11. The purpose of this IBM RedpaperTM is to cover the following topics: Describe the functions of the DB2 11 buffer pools Introduce a number of matrixes for read and write performance of a buffer pool Provide information about how to set up and monitor the DB2 buffer pools The paper is intended to be read by DB2 system administrators, but it might be of interest to any IBM z/OS® performance specialist. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with DB2 and performance tuning. In this paper, we also assume that you are familiar with DB2 11 for z/OS performance. See DB2 11 for z/OS Technical Overview, SG24-8180; and DB2 11 for z/OS Performance Topics, SG24-8222, for more information about DB2 11 functions and their performance.",

Born on a cotton plantation in 1925, the man born Riley B. King would grow up to be one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, being crowned \"The King of the Blues.\" He never wavered from his vocation, even as he gathered up other musicians in his wake and melded them into the harmony of his animating passion. In this intimate portrait of King, author Diane Williams offers a brief account of the monumental blues man's life before settling in for a series of interviews with his bandmates and beloved family members, offering readers an invaluable opportunity to feel like they know King too.",

Subsequent reports revealed that the prince had killed up to thirty Taliban insurgents in directing at least three air strikes, and that he had helped Gurkha troops repel a ground attack of Taliban insurgents using a machine gun. On February 29, Prince Harry was withdrawn from the country with distinction via a covert SAS deployment. This is the amazing story of the first British royal to serve his country in 25 years and his 10 heroic weeks of combat.",

This non-circulating T-lymphocyte subset lacks molecules enabling egress from the tissue and migration to lymph nodes, expresses specific markers of residency and displays specific transcription factors. The present special issue elucidates our current knowledge on CD8+ TRM cells and explores less frequently described resident subsets, such as CD4+ TRM and innate-like cells, as well as their specific metabolism and niches for their formation in infectious and cancer diseases.",

      "description": "Upon antigen encounter, naïve T cells differentiate into (i) effectors that combat infected or malignant cells, and at later time points, into (ii) memory cells that provide long-lasting immunity. This differentiation process allows some T cells to leave the confines of secondary lymphoid organs and to enter peripheral tissues in search of pathogens or tumor cells. These different environments pose specific challenges for effector and memory T cells to maintain homeostasis. T cells directed into the lungs are likely to encounter higher levels of oxygen, but lower amounts of nutrients than those directed into the intestinal epithelium. In addition to oxygen tension and nutrient concentrations, other key factors, such as the commensal flora and stromal components, create unique conditions that require tissue-specific adaptations of T cells. These steady state conditions can dramatically change during infection when inflammatory mediators and T cell growth factors are released, requiring the immediate response of T cells. The gradual changes imposed by growing tumors can also be challenging for T cells due to competition with rapidly cycling tumor cells that deplete essential resources of oxygen and glucose. The strategies that T cells employ to respond to the diverse cues from their surroundings are the focus of current research. It appears that next to circulating memory T cells that are confined to the circulation and those that survey all of the peripheral tissues, dedicated populations of resident memory T cells exist that can optimally adapt to the local circumstances within each tissue. Restrictions on the metabolic requirements of T cells residing in tumor tissue have been found to directly impact on effector functions such as cytokine production. The fundamental principles of how the machinery of T cells can translate local cues into tissue-specific differentiation processes are fascinating and warrant further investigation.",

With them came their precious jewels: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls... But then the Fair People vanished, taking with them their twelve fabulous treasures. And they remained hidden until now... Across North America, these twelve treasures, over ten-thousand dollars in precious jewels in 1982 dollars, are buried. The key to finding each can be found within the twelve full-color paintings and verses of THE SECRET. Are you smart enough? THE SECRET: A TREASURE HUNT was published in 1982. The year before publication, the author and publisher Byron Preiss had traveled to 12 locations in the continental U.S. (and possibly Canada) to secretly bury a dozen ceramic casques. Each casque contained a small key that could be redeemed for one of 12 jewels Preiss kept in a safe deposit box in New York. The key to finding the casques was to match one of 12 paintings to one of 12 poetic verses, solve the resulting riddle, and start digging. Since 1982, only two of the 12 casques have been recovered. The first was located in Grant Park, Chicago, in 1984 by a group of students. The second was unearthed in 2004 in Cleveland by two members of the Quest4Treasure forum.",

The chapters move between and across theories of cultural and social history, reception, adaptation, and audience studies, and offer methodological reflections on the various cultural perceptions of Tolkien’s oeuvre and its impact on twenty-first century manifestations. They analyse how discourses about fantasy are produced and mediated, and how processes of re-mediation shape our understanding of the historical coordinates and local peculiarities of fantasy in general, and Tolkien in particular, all that in Central Europe in an age of global fandom. The collection examines the entanglement of fantasy and Central European political and cultural shifts across the past 50 years and traces the ways in which its haunting legacy permeates and subverts different modes and aesthetics across different domains from communist times through today’s media-saturated culture.",

This volume represents the first sustained scholarly treatment of George R.R. Martin's groundbreaking work, and includes writing by experts involved in the production of the HBO show. The contributors investigate a number of compelling areas, including the mystery of the shape-shifting wargs, the conflict between religions, the origins of the Dothraki language and the sex lives of knights. The significance of fan cultures and their adaptations is also discussed.",

      "description": "“Reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin’s paradigm-shattering The Left Hand of Darkness, this piercingly moving story belongs in most fantasy collections.”—Library Journal There are secrets beneath her skin. Sorykah Minuit is a scholar, an engineer, and the sole woman aboard an ice-drilling submarine in the frozen land of the Sigue. What no one knows is that she is also a Trader: one who can switch genders suddenly, a rare corporeal deviance universally met with fascination and superstition and all too often punished by harassment or death. Sorykah’s infant twins, Leander and Ayeda, have inherited their mother’s Trader genes. When a wealthy, reclusive madman known as the Collector abducts the babies to use in his dreadful experiments, Sorykah and her male alter-ego, Soryk, must cross icy wastes and a primeval forest to get them back. Complicating the dangerous journey is the fact that Sorykah and Soryk do not share memories: Each disorienting transformation is like awakening with a jolt from a deep and dreamless sleep. The world through which the alternating lives of Sorykah and Soryk travel is both familiar and surreal. Environmental degradation and genetic mutation run amok; humans have been distorted into animals and animal bodies cloak a wild humanity. But it is also a world of unexpected beauty and wonder, where kindness and love endure amid the ruins. Alluring, intense, and gorgeously rendered, Ice Song is a remarkable debut by a fiercely original new writer. Praise for Ice Song “A stunning debut fantasy about love and the ties of blood.”—Armchair Interviews “Kasai’s debut is a boldly adventurous tale depicting a richly detailed world. The aspect of Traders shifting gender brings Ursula K. LeGuin’s The Left Hand of Darkness to mind, while the activities on Chen’s island are more reminiscent of Laurell K. Hamilton’s Meredith Gentry novels.”—Booklist “Ice Song is definitely a compelling read, largely due to the fact that Sorykah is such a well-developed character. She has an equally intense and complex sense of love and resentment for her children. And the fact that she exists between the world of humans and the mutants is also a source of conflict for her character . . . Ice Song is a near-perfect combination of fantasy, great storytelling and social commentary.”—Philadelphia Gay News",

Martin in his high fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire—now the basis for the hit HBO series Game of Thrones—is not only richly drawn, but also immensely popular. By A Game of Thrones' debut in May 2011, the series already had more than 6 million copies in print in the US and had sold more than 16 million worldwide. Since the television series' debut, A Game of Thrones and subsequent titles in the series have appeared consistently on the New York Times bestseller list. The latest title in the series, A Dance with Dragons, sold nearly 300,000 copies on its first day in print. Beyond the Wall explores the book series' influences, its place in the fantasy pantheon, its challenging narrative choices, and the pull of its stunningly epic scope.",

      "description": "NOW THE ACCLAIMED HBO SERIES GAME OF THRONES—THE MASTERPIECE THAT BECAME A CULTURAL PHENOMENON Winter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King’s Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert’s name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse—unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season. Yet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen’s brothers Jaime and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister—the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki—whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.",

At long last, it has arrived with The World of Ice & Fire. This lavishly illustrated volume is a comprehensive history of the Seven Kingdoms, providing vividly constructed accounts of the epic battles, bitter rivalries, and daring rebellions that lead to the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO’s Game of Thrones. In a collaboration that’s been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. García, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org—perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator.

      "description": "This book addresses controversial issues in the application of the comparative method to the languages of Australia which have recently come to international prominence. Are these languages ‘different’ in ways that challenge the fundamental assumptions of historical linguistics? Can subgrouping be successfully undertaken using the Comparative Method? Is the genetic construct of a far-flung ‘Pama-Nyungan’ language family supportable by classic methods of reconstruction? Contrary to increasingly established views of the Australian scene, this book makes a major contribution to the demonstration that traditional methods can indeed be applied to these languages. These studies, introduced by chapters on subgrouping methodology and the history of Australian linguistic classification, rigorously apply the comparative method to establishing subgroups among Australian languages and justifying the phonology of Proto-Pama-Nyungan. Individual chapters can profitably be read either for their contribution to Australian linguistic prehistory or as case studies in the application of the comparative method.",

No food is off limits—not even chocolate, pizza, burgers, or fries. With dozens of perfectly balanced meal ideas and 75 easy, tasty recipes, The One One One Diet isn’t a drop-pounds-fast fad. It’s a strategy you can use to eat healthfully and stay slim for life. Praise for The One One One Diet “A customized approach for individuals who want to start up or maintain healthy eating habits and achieve weight loss without deprivation.” —Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, LD “A simple, straightforward, easy to follow plan to help anyone get on the right track to eating well!” —Keri Glassman, MS, RD, CDN, author of The New You and Improved Diet",

      "description": "As Eckhart Tolle has written, poetry \"has been recognized since ancient times as a highly appropriate medium for the expression and transmission of spiritual truth.\" The Clear Light is Steve Taylor's latest contribution to this poetic tradition, offering short and powerful reflections as a guide to spiritual awakening and as experiential glimpses of the state of enlightenment itself. Taylor ranges widely, through subjects including \"Making the Human Race Whole,\" \"Freedom from the Past,\" and \"The Reality of Connection,\" always in clear and simple language. Best of all, he reminds us of the choices we always have when life feels chaotic and overwhelming: empathy, acceptance, and love. Soothing but also challenging, Taylor's words continually affirm the profound bedrock of peace and even joy in the present that is always available. The book's eponymous reflection says it best: There is nothing that can't be undone no past injury that can't be healed no past mistake that can't be corrected in the clear light of the present. Reading this book is a transformational spiritual experience in itself.",

This is the principle that humanity needs maximum conscious clarity about. Local Symmetry is infinitely rich and inherently circular. This empowers each individual and consequently humanity as a whole with 3 simple, nature-based organizing principles to see with holistic awareness how a prosperous, eco-intelligent future for all-planet, people, business, AI-can be realized right now. The 3 steps of awareness to fully and clearly resonate & reconnect with Nature: Why local symmetry dictates Nature’s holistic design (order) How local symmetry underpins biodiversity and informs the nature-based, holistic design of the eco-intelligent Circular Economy-from regenerative agriculture to product design and manufacturing to AI How local symmetry is the core principle of Natural Law-centering around the local individual-and provides first-principle-based, measurable guidance for International Environmental Law, or simply conscious, holistic behavior",

      "description": "Growing up African American in segregated Arkansas in the 1950s, Barbara Hendricks witnessed firsthand the painful struggle for civil rights. After graduation from the Juilliard School of Music, Hendricks immediately won a number of important international prizes, and began performing in recitals and operas throughout the world. A Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, she is as devoted to humanitarian work as she is to her music. Always the anti-diva, Hendricks is a down-to-earth and straightforward woman, whether singing Mozart or black spirituals. She challenges stereotypes and puts the music first and presents a warm, engaging, and honest self-portrait of one of the great women of music.",

      "description": "The sister of “La Diva de la Banda”—legendary Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera—opens up for the first time about Jenni’s untimely death and her own triumph over abuse and addiction. Growing up as the youngest Rivera, Rosie was surrounded by unconditional love, support, and affection. There was nothing that her family wouldn’t do for her, especially her sister Jenni, who was the most important thing in the world to Rosie. With her strong will and a solid foundation, Rosie was set to conquer the world. Yet life would take a drastic turn when Rivera was scarred by sexual abuse within her family at a very young age. Living in fear and confined by painful secrets, she was plagued with constant threats, confusion, and pain. Not only was she stripped of her childhood and innocence, but she was also robbed of her confidence and self-worth. Feeling completely shattered and lost, Rivera plunged into a world of damaging habits and deep depression. For the first time ever, and with unflinching candor and courage, Rosie shares the traumatic details of her abuse and the daily struggle to live and how, through faith and the love of her family, she found life once more. Yet Rosie’s life would be severely impacted once again as the worst tragedy imaginable hit and her biggest fear came to reality—the death of her beloved sister. Equally harrowing and uplifting, Rosie’s story is a true testament to beating the odds and proves that despite the worst of times and no matter how many more challenges life has in store, it is always possible to pick up the pieces and find the strength and purpose to dream and live again.

After all, we are all growing, and it is not only our children that can benefit from education and development, but adults too. In his constant bid for better education, author Dr. Neil Hawkes advocates a positive mental attitude which aims to empower young people with a sense of their own future and their potential to shape it according to their own purpose. Neil discusses the benefits of caring for yourself and others, as well as providing medical evidence to support these ideas. He contextualises his philosophy by demonstrating ways in which teachers, parents and pupils can use it to create a happier and more productive learning environment by raising their self-awareness and self-confidence.",

And the one problem most people with autism spectrum disorder have is this invisible and often very significant disability of lacking theory of mind. This is the innate foundation of all communication in every man, woman, and child on this Earth, and they don’t have it. I want you to walk in my shoes. I want to share my way of thinking with you, my point of view. I have constructed a group of my real stories to let you into my thoughts.

Soon as the groom arrives into The Netherlands for a family reunion, he shockingly discovers in her a spoilt woman. The man tries to save his bond of marriage but the wronged woman neither wants to be tamed due to aspects of love, nor does she co-operate. Instead, she rather wants her man to close his eyes and to shut up his mouth if ever he wishes to become a legitimate resident in her country. The egoist man doesnt compromise on self-respect of a saintly husband and thus is thrown out into streets quite empty-handed and undocumented. Then he gets afraid of going back to his homeland predicting a social ridiculous. Years passed in such a dreary and stoned life-style that one day the city police arrests him against his unlawful status and surrenders him to the foreign police who when fails to deport, sets him free like a squeezed lemon after he having served a years custodial sentence. The author describes how a few Asian immigrants and their spoiled descendants who once get settled into the Western states . forget about their past of struggling. . trap and bait to their own continent/ country-fellows by showing on them a false fairyland. . and try to demoralize a Western society by using its culture as a shield or weapon to fulfill their own sensual curiosity which seems difficult to meet in their own sender lands. The author also regrets to inflexibility of the constitution and rejects to the old theory nobody is above law. He urges on the law-makers must to defend on humanitarian grounds to those noble outlanders who become illegal by some accident, or by a misfortune befell on them and not by fraud or cheating like do often the professional invaders or regular tress-passers breaking into some countrys barriers. The whole story convincingly draws a picture of human courage and endurance against all odds mixed in shadow of oppression and optimism by giving an entire message never quit. A compulsively true heart saga with a positive energy_ readable, thought-provoking and enjoyable.",

      "description": "Once a taboo subject, victims of rape and molestation were left without a voice with nowhere to turn and no one to help them. In Take a Walk in My Shoes, author B. J. Parker shares her personal story of being raped and molested by her stepfather at a young age. She exposes the controversial topic of molestation, its long-term adverse effects on interpersonal relationships, its role in promoting self-destructive behaviors, and the need to find control. In this inspirational memoir, Parker, now fifty-three years old, comes to terms with her early abuse and tells about taking the crucial steps needed to find her way back. Take a Walk in My Shoes narrates Parkers story and how she adopted a life of alcohol and drugs to ease the constant emotional pain and how she chose to be homeless rather than live in a dwelling that had everything, including her abuser. Her story follows her journey through childhood and as a runaway teenager, a high school dropout, and a single mother. Take a Walk in My Shoes tells how she overcame the stigma of abuse by sharing the message that successes are possible for each and every victim. Parker explains how to embrace life, believe in yourself, dig deep within your soul, and hold tight to your dreams.",

      "description": "This book is for all parents: those who are pregnant, those who already are gifted with children and those future mothers and fathers just waiting for a special soul to make their life complete. For the latter, this book can be used daily for mediation and as a tool in asking for that special little person to choose us to be their parents. For those who have already been blessed with little ones, this book can be used as a valuable reminder for them as to who they are, where they are, and what their purpose in life is. We are so busy reacting to external situations in our ever-changing world that we often forget who we really are, smothering ourselves in a blanket of stress and anxiety over things that don’t really matter. The ever-observant child will learn to mimic how we deal with situations, carrying the same heavy blanket with them and can in turn lose track of what really matters, who they are and their real purpose in life. This book is about shedding those unnecessary layers to reveal our true selves so that through successful relationships we can share our love, happiness, peace, truth, and strength with each individual we come in to contact with. Please do not underestimate the capabilities of a child. Whether he or she is a teenager ,6 years old, a newborn baby or a young fetus, they all can hear us and they all feed off the love we show them. Every child, whatever their age, needs us to love them unconditionally, care for them and to be good role models. Practice this by reading the book to your loved ones, wherever they may be. I wish you the very best and I am grateful for this opportunity to share all my love, happiness, and strength with all the parents and children in this world, and beyond. Dr. Vijaya Chetty",

No one has seen or heard from Raine for six years - since she ruined Norah's own wedding and ran off with the love of Courtney's life. Convinced they should all be able to move on after so much time, Courtney gets the sisters back together again only to find that family ghosts aren't easily vanquished - and neither are first loves. Reuniting her family is going to make Courtney reconsider every decision she's made for the last six years - right down to the man she's about to marry. It's going to be one long summer...",

Whatever your situation might be, know that the universe is always on your side, and be brave to change your status quo. Have faith that there is always a way out and a plethora of divine guidance available to you. You might consult an oracle or a psychic or visit a healer. You might learn how to pay attention to an omen. You might attend a workshop to get back in touch with the innate abilities we all were born with. Take a leap of faith and move ahead on the road to expansion and ultimately, wholeness. Only then can you find true happiness and joy.",

      "description": "Abstract: Total weights and volumes, above stump, were determined for 71 northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) trees 6 to 24 inches d.b.h. growing in fully stocked oak-hickory stands in western North Carolina. Equations are presented for predicting green and dry weights and green volume of the total tree, above stump, and its components using d.b.h. and total height, d.b.h. and height to a 4-inch top, d.b.h. and saw-log merchantable height, and d.b.h. along. Tablesdeveloped from equations show weight and volume of the total tree and it components by d.b.h. and total height classes. Seventy-five percent of total-tree weight was in stem to a 4-inch top and 25 percent in crown. The average tree had 85 percent of its green weight in wood and 15 percent in bark. Total-tree wood had an average specific gravity of 0.581, and average moisture content of 80 percent, and an average green weight per cubic foot of 65 pounds. The average weightof wood and bark per cubic foot of wood for the total tree was 77 pounds.",

      "description": "This book explores fundamental aspects of geometric network optimisation with applications to a variety of real world problems. It presents, for the first time in the literature, a cohesive mathematical framework within which the properties of such optimal interconnection networks can be understood across a wide range of metrics and cost functions. The book makes use of this mathematical theory to develop efficient algorithms for constructing such networks, with an emphasis on exact solutions. Marcus Brazil and Martin Zachariasen focus principally on the geometric structure of optimal interconnection networks, also known as Steiner trees, in the plane. They show readers how an understanding of this structure can lead to practical exact algorithms for constructing such trees. The book also details numerous breakthroughs in this area over the past 20 years, features clearly written proofs, and is supported by 135 colour and 15 black and white figures. It will help graduate students, working mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists to understand the principles required for designing interconnection networks in the plane that are as cost efficient as possible.",

      "description": "Time in early America when the Indian Nations lived undisturbed by European intervention comes alive. A great lake fixes an assortment of native traditions and cultures. Forested hills, open grassy meadows, green river valleys and rocky mountain retreats bound this great body of water. These natural boundaries form the secluded homelands of neighboring tribes that circumvent the perimeter of a large lake. The rite of passage into manhood of a young Indian is followed. The saga of a boy becoming a warrior unfolds in a series of adventurous episodes. The ensuing encounters reveal the variety of spiritual beliefs, living standards and tribal practices among the first nations. The young hero is led upon a journey directed by the foretelling from the spirit world. An assortment of native characters appears to reveal the details of life passing long ago in the wilderness. The fullness of living free in the woods and forests of America is shared. The reader fully participates through transportation into primitive rustic American existence.",

      "description": "Yongning Na, also known as Mosuo, is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Southwest China. This book provides a description and analysis of its tone system, progressing from lexical tones towards morphotonology. Tonal changes permeate numerous aspects of the morphosyntax of Yongning Na; they are not the product of a small set of phonological rules, but of a host of rules that are restricted to specific morphosyntactic contexts. Rich morphotonological systems have been reported in this area of Sino-Tibetan, but book-length descriptions remain few. This study of an endangered language contributes to a better understanding of the diversity of prosodic systems in East Asia. The analysis is based on original fieldwork data (made available online), collected over the course of ten years, commencing in 2006.",

Many movements in the form «Siu Leem Tau» and in “Form 108 on the wooden dummy” are masked and hidden techniques of chin-na. This book deciphers the movement of the forms of Wing Chun that are used for escaping from grips. This is the first level of chin-na in Wing-Chun. The purpose of the book is to summarize the principles of escaping from the grips, and not to collect all the techniques. The main thing is not the maximum number of techniques, but an understanding of biomechanics and principles of escaping from grips.",

Kao Fransoaz Sagan u Srbiji, danas. Radmila Stanković, novinarka NIN-a Ova knjiga je najfiniji proizvod duha Biljane Willimon. Istog onog koji zrači i sa njenih slika, naročito onda kad odluči da bude duhovita. Retka vrlina vrlo inteligentnih ljudi. Ivana Hadži Popović, književnica Autofikcijska knjiga Biljane Willimon romantični je ljubavni roman. To je dnevnik pisan u doba korone, nostalgična ispovest multimedijalne umetnice, svrstane među srpske „ikone stila“. Duhovit pogled na godine koje su nam pojeli skakavci, intrigantna priča o intimnim doživljajima jednog autentičnog ženskog dendija. Prof. dr Neda Todorović Roman Biljane Willimon, sa zadovoljstvom će se čitati i kad korona prođe. U njenoj ljubavnoj priči, uz ostale, uživaće i vlasnica knjižare u Berlinu, vajarka iz Valensije, kućevlasnica na Menhetnu, sestra milosnica iz Dubrovnika, rimska novinarka, galeristkinja iz Pariza...

      "description": "The stories of Kauai's ruling chiefs were passed from generation to generation in songs and narratives recited by trained storytellers either formally at the high chief's court or informally at family gatherings. Their chronology was ordered by a ruler's genealogy, which, in the case of the pua alii (flower of royalty), was illustrious and far reaching and could be traced to one of the four great gods of Polynesia--Käne, Kü, Lono, and Kanaloa. In these legends, Hawaiians of old sought answers to the questions \"Who are we?\" \"Who are our ancestors and where do they come from?\" \"What lessons can be learned from their conduct?\" Nä Pua Alii o Kauai presents the stories of the men and women who ruled the island of Kauai from its first settlement to the final rebellion against Kamehameha I's forces in 1824. Only fragments remain of the nearly two-thousand-year history of the people who inhabited Kauai before the coming of James Cook in 1778. Now scattered in public and private archives and libraries, these pieces of Hawaii's precontact past were recorded in the nineteenth century by such determined individuals as David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Abraham Fornander. All known genealogical references to the Kauai alii nui (paramount chiefs) have been gathered here and placed in chronological order and are interspersed with legends of great voyages, bitter wars, courageous heroes, and passionate romances that together form a rich and invaluable resource.",

      "description": "The acclaimed actress and author of Jesse: A Mother’s Story tells the \"entertaining and moving\" story of her outspoken, frequently outrageous Italian immigrant mother (Tom Perrotta) Marianne Leone’s Ma is in many senses a larger-than-life character, one who might be capable, even from the afterlife, of shattering expectations. Born on a farm in Italy, Linda finds her way to the United States under dark circumstances, having escaped a forced marriage to a much older man, and marries a good Italian boy. She never has full command of English—especially when questioned by authorities—and when she is suddenly widowed with three young children, she has few options. To her daughter’s horror and misery, she becomes the school lunch lady. Ma Speaks Up is a record of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, with the wrong family, in the wrong religion. Though Marianne’s girlhood is flooded with shame, it’s equally packed with adventure, love, great cooking, and, above all, humor. The extremely premature birth of Marianne’s beloved son, Jesse, bonds mother and daughter in ways she couldn’t have imagined. The stories she tells will speak to anyone who has struggled with outsider status in any form and, of course, to mothers and their blemished, cherished girls.",

      "description": "This book is part of a series which makes available to English-speaking audiences the work of the individual Chinese economists who were the architects of China’s economic reform. The series provides an inside view of China’s economic reform, revealing the thinking of the reformers themselves, unlike many other books on China’s economic reform which are written by outside observers. Ma Hong (1920-2007) was one of the leading advocates for China’s market-oriented reforms, one of the earliest scholars to adopt the concept of \"a socialist market economy\". Politically active from the 1930s, when he campaigned against the Japanese occupation, he held many important posts, notably President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in the 1980s. He was particularly influential in the field of industrial economics, putting to use his own experiences of managing industrial enterprises, and a strong advocate of the need for China’s economic development to be stable. The book is published in association with China Development Research Foundation, one of the leading economic and social think tanks in China, where many of the theoretical foundations and policy details of economic reform were formulated.",

'The Moon Pool' is a fantasy novel set on the island of Ponape amongst ruins of an ancient civilisation. It tells the tale of adventurous explorers who discover an unknown world. Abraham Grace Merritt - also known by his byline, A. Merritt - was born on the 20th January, 1884 in New Jersey, America. Merritt's stories typically revolved around conventional pulp magazine themes. His heroes are gallant Irishmen or Scandinavians, his villains treacherous Germans or Russians and his heroines often virginal, mysterious and scantily clad. Merritt married twice, once in the 1910s to Eleanore Ratcliffe, with whom he raised an adopted daughter, and again in the thirties to Eleanor H. Johnson.",

What if, contrary to what we have long been told, spontaneity - not striving - is the answer to success?

When Michael Jackson died, millions of people were affected and many felt that there was something strange around his death. In this book you will have intimate insights into Michael's personal world, for the first time in the form of a novel, and perhaps find a new answer. This is about the moving spectrum of feelings behind his dramas - taking into account his spiritual interests, but above all the question as to why ... why did he of all people have to experience disasters of this scale? The touching and poignant story of Michael Jackson as the emotional story of his life: nuances that are so often and readily omitted by the tabloids, his thoughts, feelings, fears, especially in the last two years before his death - are based on details, facts and background knowledge of people who knew Michael personally. Michael always said: Before you judge me, try hard to love me. This is an important piece of truth about Michael – share the thrill, read the book, gift it, review it, criticize it - give the truth around Michael Jackson a chance - let the true Michael live!",

First delivered as lectures in the 1960s, when Booth was a professor at Earlham College and the University of Chicago, Now Don’t Try to Reason with Me still resounds with anyone struggling for consensus in a world of us versus them. “Professor Booth’s earnestness is graced by wit, irony, and generous humor.”—Louis Coxe, New Republic",

      "description": "Diego Rivera, Dorothea Lange, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel: Art and activism have long been intertwined, and the political fallout has resulted in an artistic canon riddled with historical holes. One of the most glaring omissions from most listings of American art masters is Ad Reinhardt (1913–67). An artist who had significant ties to the American Communist movement and leftist political organizations, Reinhardt and his contributions to modern art have been largely pushed out of the spotlight for political reasons. But in this unprecedented in-depth study of Reinhardt’s life and work, Michael Corris returns the artist to his rightful place in the history of modern art and culture. A pioneering avant-garde artist with fierce political beliefs, Reinhardt immersed himself in the vibrant left-wing political and cultural circles of the 1930s and ’40s, only to be marginalized by the social and cultural conservatism that arose in postwar America. Corris examines Reinhardt’s work against this historical background, charting the development of his entire oeuvre, ranging from his abstract paintings to his popular graphic artwork, illustrations and cartoons. Ad Reinhardt also re-evaluates Reinhardt’s role and influence in the art world, chronicling his time as an artist and educator at the California School of Fine Arts, University of Wyoming, Yale University, and Hunter College, and examining his influence on younger artists who created successive avant-garde movements such as minimal and conceptual art. A long-awaited examination of a less-heralded American master, Ad Reinhardt is a fascinating portrait of an artist whose political radicalism infused his art with a poignant resonance that stretches, through this rediscovery, into the present.",

With little leagues, school teams, community recreation clubs, farm teams, and Major League Baseball, it is no wonder the game is so popular. When Craig Barnes and his friends broke a window in their neighborhood as a result of their lively game of baseball, the group of youngsters invented miniature baseball. This breakthrough version of their favorite game could be played in a smaller space and utilized a ball that wouldn’t break any windows! Small Ball: The Blessings of Miniature Baseball introduces you to the game of miniature baseball and provides you with a complete set of rules and instructions for how to play the game. Unlike traditional baseball, the unique scoring system of miniature baseball allows you to play the game with as few as two people. And with handicaps for advanced players, both young and old rookies can enjoy playing alongside those with more experience, thus mentoring and sharing the love of baseball with all generations, including those who live with handicaps.",

Wide-rent, the clouds Pour a whole flood, and yet, its flame unquenched, Th’unconquerable lightning struggles through. Ragged and fierce, or in red whirling balls, And fires the mountains with redoubled rage. Black from the stroke, above, the smould’ring pine Stands a sad shattered trunk; and, stretched below, A lifeless group the blasted cattle lie. James Thompson, “The Seasons” (1727) have been investigating ball lightning for more than two decades. I published a ball lightning report in Nature in 1976 that received worldwide publicity and I consequently many people wrote to me with accounts of their own experiences. Within a very short time, I had accumulated about 200 firsthand accounts, and the file has continued to grow steadily since then. Several things impressed me. Few of those who wrote to me had any detailed foreknowledge of ball lightning at the time of their observation. Nonetheless, once reports of other phenomena such as St. Elmo’s fire had been eliminated, the remaining descriptions were remarkably consistent. Furthermore, nearly all who contacted me were keen to have an explanation of what they had seen and seemed entirely sincere.",

      "description": "The intelligent sports analysis of a soccer ball (also known as football, football ball, or association football ball) requires accurately simulating its motion and finding the best design parameters. Employing classic mechanics, this book establishes a fundamental framework for the soccer ball multi-body dynamics modeling, virtual prototype simulation and optimization design. It presents 3D virtual prototypes to predict the soccer ball trajectory for soccer players and trainers. Five typical case studies have addressed in the kinematics and dynamics simulations of soccer ball projectile motion, free kick, and corner kick in the virtual environment. The research on multi-body dynamics models provides a useful method for engineers and scientists to investigate the spatial kinematics and dynamics performances of various balls, such as soccer ball, gulf ball, American football, etc. The book is significant to guide undergraduate and graduate students from multi-disciplines to study system dynamics and optimization design.",

      "description": "An experimental apparatus was designed and constructed at the NASA Lewis Research Center to study one aspect of spinning friction based on interfacial slip over the entire ball-race contact area. The apparatus is capable of measuring spinning moments of less than 0. Ol inch-pound at maximum Hertz contact stresses to over 400 000 psi, speeds to 3500 rpm, and under varying contact configurations and conditions. From the torque measurement, a coefficient of spinning friction can be calculated. The apparatus comprises a drive assembly, a dead-weight load assembly, a spherical upper test specimen, a cylindrically grooved lower test specimen of varying conformity, a lower test specimen housing assembly incorporating a hydrostatic air-bearing assembly, and a torque-measuring system. In operation, the upper test specimen is loaded against the lower test specimen through the drive shaft assembly by the dead- weight load assembly. As the drive assembly is rotated, the upper test specimen rotates against the stationary lower test specimen actuating the torque-measuring system. Preliminary tests were conducted under varying Hertz stress to 136 000-psi maximum Hertz stress at a spinning speed of 950 rpm, with a 51 percent ball-groove conformity using a polyphenyl ether (5P4E), a highly purified naphthenic mineral oil, and a di-2-ethylhexyl sebacate (MIL-7808). It was found that the coefficient of spinning friction decreased with increasing maximum Hertz stress to an intermediate stress level and had a minimum value of 0. 122, 0. 089, and 0. 050, respectively, for the lubricants listed previously.",

      "description": "Never before has the whole world of cricket been collected in one, really quite large volume. Les Scott has collected a lifetime of anecdotes, records, quotes and cuttings to make The Essential Cricket Book. With a century of sections detailing everything from balls and slips to pavilions, umpires and teas; all the Test-playing nations, first-class counties as well as minor counties and clubs, plus universities; tournaments from the Ashes through the old John Player League to the Sheffield Shield (not to mention the KFC Twenty20 Big Bash); bizarre dismissals and of course LBWs, all the great games and characters of cricket are brought to life. It's all here: the first player to wear a helmet, the first man to attempt a reverse sweep, the games when camels (or mackerels) stopped play, the batsmen given out 'absent, thought lost on the Tube' and 'retired, suffering from measles', or simply the last England bowler to take a wicket with the first ball of a Test Match.",

      "description": "One of the mathematical challenges of modern physics lies in the development of new tools to efficiently describe different branches of physics within one mathematical framework. This text introduces precisely such a broad mathematical model, one that gives a clear geometric expression of the symmetry of physical laws and is entirely determined by that symmetry.The first three chapters discuss the occurrence of bounded symmetric domains (BSDs) or homogeneous balls and their algebraic structure in physics. The book further provides a discussion of how to obtain a triple algebraic structure associated to an arbitrary BSD; the relation between the geometry of the domain and the algebraic structure is explored as well. The last chapter contains a classification of BSDs revealing the connection between the classical and the exceptional domains.With its unifying approach to mathematics and physics, this work will be useful for researchers and graduate students interested in the many physical applications of bounded symmetric domains. It will also benefit a wider audience of mathematicians, physicists, and graduate students working in relativity, geometry, and Lie theory.",

Spencer carefully examines each part of the letter and relates it to the overall flow of the argument and in light of the larger biblical, historical, social, and cultural contexts. How Paul's writing related to the ancient communities is highlighted in the light of original data gleaned from her explorations on location in Crete, Ephesus, and Rome. In addition, Paul's rhetorical and ministry strategies, especially as they relate to women and their role in the church, are explored. Throughout, Spencer presents an in-depth exegesis in a readable format enhanced by forty years of ministry.",

With each step that Goku takes, you'll discover more of the hidden spirituality and symbolism in Dragon Ball that makes the series so successful. You'll see how author Akira Toriyama synthesizes Chinese culture, Western technology, and Buddho-Daoist philosophy to create a series that speaks to your humanity. Not because of the action or the humor, but because it reminds you of what it means to be alive. Along the way you'll learn of Goku's ancient origin. You'll hear how the legend of a wild monkey-man begins in India, evolves across 2,000 years of Chinese and Japanese history, and leads to the Goku you know and love. I'll walk you through the journey from the first page to the last. And by the time we're done, you will be an expert on Dragon Ball's culture.

      "description": "Dragon Ball di Akira Toriyama è la serie anime e manga più conosciuta al mondo e ha appassionato milioni di fan da ogni parte del globo. La leggendaria rivalità degli ultimi due Saiyan dal sangue puro, Goku e Vegeta, è l’esempio per antonomasia di un eterno conflitto che ispira i fan a superare i propri limiti. Con le prefazioni di Ryō Horikawa e Gianluca Iacono, rispettivamente la voce di Vegeta in giapponese e in italiano, Dragon Ball Z “It’s Over 9,000!” Visioni del mondo in collisione è il primo libro a spiegare da dove proviene “It’s Over 9,000!”, come si è diffuso il video originale fino a ricevere 7 milioni di visualizzazioni e perché continua ad essere uno slogan così popolare. Con un’analisi davvero meticolosa delle visioni del mondo in collisione di Goku e Vegeta, questo libro aiuta il lettore a comprendere meglio perché il conflitto è necessario per una profonda crescita personale e lo sviluppo caratteriale. Con riferimenti ai sistemi di credenze dell’Asia orientale e paradigmi futuristici di alta tecnologia, Derek Padula, l’autore della serie di libri e del blog The Dao of Dragon Ball, fornisce una profonda comprensione di questa storia epica e dei suoi valori intrinseci. Cambierà per sempre la tua visione di Dragon Ball Z.",

      "description": "Anime is exploding on the worldwide stage! Anime has been a staple in Japan for decades, strongly connected to manga. So why has anime become a worldwide sensation? A cursory explanation is the explosion of online streaming services specializing in anime, like Funimation and Crunchyroll. Even more general streaming services like Netflix and Amazon have gotten in on the game. Anime is exotic to Western eyes and culture. That is one of the reasons anime has gained worldwide popularity. This strange aesthetic draws the audience in only to find it is deeper and more sophisticated than its surface appearance. Japan is an honor and shame culture. Anime provides a platform to discuss “universal” problems facing human beings. It does so in an amazing variety of ways and subgenres, and often with a sense of humor. The themes, characters, stories, plotlines, and development are often complex. This makes anime a deep well of philosophical, metaphysical, and religious ideas for analysis. International scholars are represented in this book. There is a diversity of perspectives on a diversity of anime, themes, content, and analysis. It hopes to delve deeper into the complex world of anime and demonstrate why it deserves the respect of scholars and the public alike.",

      "description": "The biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is a cornerstone of Western civilization, yet there are still many mysteries concerning its origins and meaning. In The Mythology of Eden, Arthur and Elena George utilize new historical and archaeological discoveries to reveal how the story’s author uses veiled symbolism and mythological storytelling to convey his message about the most profound questions of human existence regarding the divine, life, death, and immortality. This innovative book offers an interdisciplinary interpretation of the Eden story that delves into incorrect assumptions and brings to light details that have previously gone unnoticed. The Mythology of Eden provides a new understanding of the story of Adam and Eve and illuminates the story’s role and meaning in our modern world.",

      "description": "Ronald D. Lankford has written the definitive history of this iconic and much-loved Christmas character. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was the creation of Robert May, a staff copywriter who wrote the original poem as a Montgomery Ward Christmas giveaway in 1939. More than 2.4 million copies were printed and given away that holiday season. Thus the legend began. Johnny Marks adapted the poem into what would become the Gene Autry hit &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,&quot; which instantly became - and still remains - one of the most popular Christmas songs of all time. The legend of Rudolph soared even higher with the Rankin/Bass stop-motion television special in 1964, which has gone on to inspire a cottage industry of toys and decorative items. In this festive and informed look at the most famous reindeer of all, Lankford discusses all of Rudolph's iterations, including comic books, sequels, advertising tie-ins, movies, and much more. Lankford has produced the first complete history of Rudolph that both celebrates and explains the undying popularity of Rudolph and his friends. The result is both a glowing tribute and a rigorously researched biography that will appeal to fans and lovers of classic American holiday culture.",

Both are sustained by violence and dominated by men – and both claim to be the favored children of Gela, the woman who came to Eden long ago on a boat that could cross the stars, and became the mother of them all.<br> When young Starlight Brooking meets a handsome and powerful man from across Worldpool, she believes he will offer an outlet for her ambition and energy. But she has no inkling that she will become a stand-in for Gela herself, and wear Gela’s fabled ring on her own finger—or that in this role, powerful and powerless all at once, she will try to change the course of Eden’s history.",

A member of one of the most prominent families in town, the victim seemingly has no enemies. But, if that was true, why would someone torture him and dump his naked body in the middle of Town Square? That is one of the many questions SBI Detective Donovan Wolf intends to answer during his stay in this quaint town. As he investigates, he quickly learns that things are not exactly as they seem. the town is shrouded in secrecy and steeped in religious fanaticism. While there is no shortage of suspects, there is only circumstantial evidence. to make matters worse, the townspeople seem more intent on gossip than finding the killer. As he deals with false leads and hidden threats from the murderer, Wolf struggles to make sense of the evidence and fight against his own self-doubt. Will he ever find the evidence he needs to bring Jared's killer to justice or will this murder become just another unsolved case? When Wolf finally comes face to face with the killer, he begins the fight of his life. If he wins, the killer will be brought to justice and Jared will be vindicated. If he loses, he will become the killer's second victim and the truth will die with him.",

      "numPages": 370,
      "description": "When the United States established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union in 1933, it did more than normalize relations with the new Bolshevik state-it opened the door to a parade of Russian spies. In the 1930s and 1940s, Soviet engineers and technicians, under the guise of international cooperation, reaped a rich harvest of intelligence from our industrial plants. Factory layouts, aircraft blueprints, fuel formulas-all were grist for the Soviet espionage mill. And that, as Katherine Sibley shows, was just the beginning. While most historians date the onset of the Cold War with American fears of Soviet global domination after World War II, Sibley shows that it actually began during the war itself. The uncovering of atomic espionage in 1943 in particular not only led to increased surveillance of our ostensible Russian allies but also underscored a growing distrust of the Soviet Union that would eventually morph into full-blown hostility. Meticulously documented through exhaustive new research in American and Soviet archives, Sibley's book provides the most detailed study of Soviet military-industrial espionage to date, revealing that the United States knew much more about Soviet operations than previously acknowledged. She tells of spies like Steve Nelson and Clarence Hiskey, who passed on information about the Manhattan Project; moles within the federal government like Nathan Silvermaster; and Soviet agents like Andrei Schevchenko, who pressed defense workers to divulge high tech secrets. At the same time, as Sibley shows, hundreds of other Red agents went completely undetected. It was only through the revelations of defectors, and the postwar cracking of Soviet codes, that we began to fully understand these breaches in our national security. Sibley describes how our response to this wartime espionage shaped a generation of Red-baiting-triggering loyalty programs, blacklists, and the infamous HUAC hearings-and how it has clouded U.S.-Russian relations down to the present day. She also reviews recent cases-John Walker, Jr., Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen-that demonstrate how Russian efforts to gain American secrets continues well into our present times. For Cold War-watchers and spy aficionados alike, Sibley's work spells out what we actually knew about communist espionage and suggests how and why that knowledge should also shape our understanding of intelligence in the Age of Terrorism.",

Messi's final peak conquered; his final dream achieved. It was the fairy tale ending to a glittering career. Yet despite delivering Argentina their third World Cup, Messi's time at Paris Saint-Germain came to a dramatic conclusion, and Miami awaited the Argentinian legend.<br><br>Guillem Balagué has had unprecedented access to Messi's inner circle including the player himself: his coaches, team-mates and family. From tracing the origins of Messi's precocious talent in Rosario, Argentina, to chronicling his peerless seventeen-season career at Barcelona, and his tumultuous Parisian adventure, Guillem takes us behind-the-scenes of Messi's World Cup triumph and his long-desired move to the MLS. This is an epic, authoritative and compelling account of an enigmatic footballing genius.<br><br> <b><i>'I can tell my grandkids one day that I coached Lionel Messi' Pep Guardiola</i></b></p>",

      "description": "<b>A provocative argument for a new way of seeing Israel, Zionism, and the two-state solution.</b><br><br><i>Haifa Republic: A Democratic Future for Israel</i> is an urgent wake-up call. The philosopher Omri Boehm argues that it is long past time to recognize that there will not be a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. After fifty years, Israel’s occupation of the West Bank constitutes annexation in all but name, even as the legitimate claims of the Arab population, soon to be a national majority, remain unaddressed. Meanwhile, daily life goes on under conditions rightly likened to apartheid. For liberals in Israel and America to continue to place their hopes in a two-state solution is a form of willful and culpable blindness, especially now that Israeli leaders across the political spectrum have begun to speak of ethnic cleansing. A catastrophe is in the making.<br><br>But <i>Haifa Republic</i> also offers grounds for hope. Catastrophe can be averted, Boehm contends, by reconfiguring Israel as a single binational state in which Palestinians and Jews both possess human rights and equal citizenship. The original Zionists—Theodor Herzl, Ze’ev Jabotinsky, and, early in his career, David Ben-Gurion—all advocated such a federation, and as prime minister, Menachem Begin successfully submitted a kindred plan to the Knesset. A binational federation offers a last chance for the two peoples who call Palestine home to live in peace and mutual respect and to have a truly democratic future in common.",
